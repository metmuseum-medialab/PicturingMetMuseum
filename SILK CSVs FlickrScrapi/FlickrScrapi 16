(129.5 x 196.2 cm);Catharine Lorillard Wolfe Collection, Wolfe Fund, 1931 (31.45);;Accused by the Athenian government of denying the gods and corrupting the young through his teachings, Socrates (469399 B.C.) was offered the choice of renouncing his beliefs or being sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. David shows him calmly discoursing on the immortality of the soul with his grief-stricken disciples. Painted in 1787, the picture, with its stoic theme, is perhaps David's most perfect Neoclassical statement. The printmaker and publisher John Boydell wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds that it was &quot;the greatest effort of art since the Sistine Chapel and the stanze of Raphael. . . . This work would have done honour to Athens at the time of Pericles.&quot; The subject is loosely based on Plato's Phaedo, but in painting it David consulted a variety of sources, including Diderot's treatise on dramatic poetry of 1758 and works by the poet Andre Chenier. The pose of the figure at the foot of the bed was reportedly inspired by a passage in a novel by the English writer Richardson.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/09/euwf/ho_31.45.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/09/euwf/ho_31.45.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: david,ElissaSCA: socrates,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: neoclassicism,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 16","4573700736.jpg","31.62","Tables for Ladies by Edward Hopper in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2009","ElissaSCA","Tables for Ladies, 1930;Edward Hopper (American, 18821967);Oil on canvas ;48 1/4 x 60 1/4 in.

The viewer's gaze is directed past the menu cards and the vividly painted foods in the window display and the waitress who leans forward to adjust them, into an interior of polished wood, tiled floors, and wall mirrors where a man and woman eat and a cashier attends to business at her register. Hopper painted this large canvas in the studio, working from sketches that he had made of local restaurants. Yet despite the bright lighting and the warm, even garish, colors, this is not a particularly festive scene. The two diners chat between themselves, but the cashier and the waitress are lost in their separate thoughts and duties. As in many of his works, Hopper indirectly comments on the loneliness and weariness that so many city dwellers experience.;;Despite Hopper's reluctance to assign historical context to his work, this painting also speaks of several social changes of the era. For example, it represents the new roles that women were occupying in public; both the cashier and the waitress, for example, are women working outside the home. The title also alludes to a recent social innovation, in which dining establishments advertised &quot;tables for ladies&quot; in order to welcome their newly mobile female customers. In the past, it had often been assumed that women appearing alone in restaurants or bars were prostitutes in search of business; now, dining on their own or with other women, they would be treated respectfully.

The figures here are delicate and expressive, the atmosphere luminous, and the handling sprightly and fluent.;;The canvas shows the central hall of the principal gaming establishment in Venice, the Ridotto at Palazzo Dandolo, between San Moise and San Marco. This public Ridotto opened in 1638; was redecorated in the Rococo style in 1768; and six years later was shut down by the government for reasons of public morality.

William Middendorf II Gifts, 1985;;Accession Number: 1985.209;;;Description:;;Two prevailing influences converged somewhere between the Baltic and the Black Sea to initiate the development of this kind of brooch. Examples of small silver bow fibulae with square or rectangular heads, which originated in the Crimea and date from the third century A.D., are thought to have provided the model for the square or rectangular head of the type. Northern elements are represented by the open-jawed heads of the monsters just below the bow, in addition to other animal motifs, and by the partitioned, lozenge-shaped foot plate, whose surface is decorated with &quot;kerbshnitt&quot; (chip carving) and its extremities with raised knobs (the one on the end of the foot is now missing). Dividing the foot is a strip of niello (a black substance containing silver, copper, lead, and sulphur) terminating in an animal's head, and above the foot is a pair of stylized animal heads with gaping jaws.;;The bow is plain and is divided into panels by bands of niello. It is the border of freestanding masks that sets the Museum's example apart from the majority of great square-headed brooches, and allies it to a small group identified as the Lutton Heath type. The Museum's brooch, like most of the approximately 150 known square-headed examples that were made in England throughout the sixth century, displays the Anglo-Saxon preference for lavish surface decoration. These brooches, traditionally of gilt bronze, were used to secure the garments of peasant farmers. They were worn with the head plate upward, unlike some of the related Continental bow fibulae.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/medieval_art/square_headed_bow_brooch//objectview.aspx?OID=170006035&amp;collID=17&amp;dd1=17 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/mediev...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: brooch,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: copper,ElissaSCA: middleages,3D,Art2or3,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 16","5789981610.jpg","1981.413","Open-Ring Brooch in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, April 2011","ElissaSCA","Open Ring Brooch, early 800s;Pictish or Irish; Found near Galway, Ireland;Silver with amber insets ;Diam. 2 3/8 in.

This statuette was found in Egypt together with an identical figure that is now in the collection of the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore.;;The subject's identity has been much debated and remains a mystery. He may represent Attis, a god of vegetation from Phrygia in central Anatolia. It also has been suggested that the existence of two copies of the same statuette may reflect a double geographical reference- that is, if set up together, the twin figures could be identified as the personifications of Armenia Major and Armenia Minor. However, the images are so similar that more likely they represent the same individual. More recently, the statuette has been identified as a portrait of Alexander Helios, son of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII, as prince of Armenia after Mark Antony's conquest in 34 BC. On the other hand, the mannered style, the exotic dress, and moderate scale of this figure likely signal a decorative function for the statuette, possibly as a lamp or incense-burner stand.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,The Lady of Shalot: ptolemaic,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,3D,Art2or3,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 16","2072788646.jpg","54.11.3","Terracotta Greek Gorgon Head in the Study Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Title: Terracotta antefix (roof tile);;Medium; Technique: Terracotta;;Culture: Greek;;Period: Archaic;;Date: ca. 500 B.C.;;Dimensions: Other: 6 in.

Faint bands at the woman's neck indicate creases; the subtle folds of flesh along the right side of the torso emphasize the full curves of her figure. Reclining figures are common among Greek terracottas, and the appearance of the posture in Mesopotamian sculpture may reflect the influence of Greek terracotta manufacturing centers along the eastern Mediterranean. The majority of Greek terracottas of this type are male, however, as are reclining figures depicted in Greco-Roman funerary reliefs. In Mesopotamia, the opposite is true: whether the figurine is fashioned of alabaster or terracotta, the subject is usually a woman.

(37 x 29 mm);Purchase, Joseph Pulitzer Bequest, 1942 (42.11.30);;Cameos were a highly developed art form that involved carving details on multilayered gemstones or colored glass so as to leave a white surface in relief against a dark background. Gems and glass were engraved using a drill with changeable heads and a bow wrapped around the drill shaft that was drawn back and forth to make it rotate.;;The art of gem cutting reached its peak under Augustus. Gems often bore overtly propagandistic subjects, such as this cameo portraying Augustus with semidivine attributes. The cream-colored portrait rises masterfully from the violet-tinged brown translucent ground. Famous since the seventeenth century, when it was in the Arundel collection (it was later in the Marlborough collection), this virtuoso demonstration of the Roman gem cutter's skill shows the mature but energetic and well-muscled emperor from the back, his head in noble profile, the ribbons of his laurel wreath floating behind him. He turns his back so that his shoulder displays his baldric and the aegis incorporating heads of Medusa and a wind god. The latter is perhaps intended as a personification of the summer winds that brought the corn fleet from Egypt and, thus, an oblique reference to Augustus' annexation of Egypt after the defeat of Marc Antony and Cleopatra at Actium in 31 B.C.

(185.42 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1925 (25.78.56);;This statue is known as a Diadoumenos, a youth tying a fillet around his head after a victory in an athletic contest. It is a first-century A.D. Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 430 B.C. The original bronze probably stood in a sanctuary such as that at Olympia or Delphi, where games were regularly held. Ancient literary accounts (Lucian, Philopseudes, 18; Pliny, N.H. xxxiv, 15) and over forty known copies attest to the original bronze being one of the most highly esteemed creations of Polykleitos, the renowned Greek sculptor from Argos who worked during the midfifth century B.C. Both in his sculpture and in a written text, the Canon, Polykleitos sought to represent the nude male figure with perfect harmony among all parts and according to principles that could be reproduced by others. He carefully designed his figures with special attention paid to bodily proportions and stance, so that the effect of the whole is singularly harmonious. The thorax and pelvis of the Diadoumenos tilt in opposite directions, setting up rhythmic contrasts in the torso that create an impression of organic vitality. The position of the feet poised between standing and walking give a sense of potential movement. This rigorously calculated pose, which is found in almost all works attributed to Polykleitos, became a standard formula used in Greco-Roman and, later, western European art.;;Of this marble copy, the head, arms, legs from the knees down, and tree trunk are ancient. The remainder of the figure was cast from a marble copy found at Delos and now in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The head is practically intact with even the nose unbroken. The sharply carved eyelids bordered by ridges suggesting lashes, the transverse incision on the lower lip, and the crisply carved curls indicate a faithful rendering of the bronze original.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/hod_25.78.56.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/hod_25.78.56.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: diadoumenos,ElissaSCA: polykleitos,ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: city,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: classical,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: athlete,ElissaSCA: youth,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: copy,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 16","935127442.jpg","03.12.8b","Marble Head of a Hellenistic Ruler in the Metropolitan Museum, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble head of a Hellenistic ruler.;Roman, Imperial period, 1st or 2nd century AD;Copy or adaptation of a Greek portrait of the early 3rd century BC.;;Accession # 03.12.8b;;The flat fillet worn by this young man is an insignium of kingship.

Although the features are cast in a thoroughly classical style typical of the late 4th century BC, the face is stamped with enough individuality to identify it as a portrait. In all probability, it represents a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, that succession of Macedonian Greeks who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC until the annexation of Egypt by Rome and the suicide of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC. Most recently, this head has been identified as Arsinoe II, who ruled together with her brother Ptolemy II, from 278 until her death in 270 BC. Not only was the queen part of a dynastic ruler cult during her life, she was also transformed into an independent deity by her brother after her death. She was worshiped as an Egyptian goddess in association with Isis and also separately as a Greek goddess, with her own sanctuaries and festivals. This strongly idealized head, which resembles classical images of Hera and Demeter was probably associated with the latter cult. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/greek_roman/viewone.asp?item=5>www.metmuseum.org/special/greek_roman/viewone.asp?item=5</a> and the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: woman,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,The Lady of Shalot: ptolemaic,3D,Art2or3,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 16","941517127.jpg","32.11.4","The Wounded Amazon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  July 2007","ElissaSCA","Statue of a wounded Amazon, 1st2nd century A.D.;Roman copy of a Greek bronze statue, ca. 450425 B.C.;Marble (Pentelic); H. 80 1/4 in.
