(5.1 x 11.1 x 0.3cm);;Nose ornaments are among the earliest jewelry forms in Precolumbian America and were made in an endless variety of materials and styles; those for the elite were made of precious metal. In Peru, nose ornaments became less fashionable in the second half of the first millennium A.D. and were seldom used after about 600. This elegant, very delicate crescent nose ring from northern Peru is evidence of the high level of craftsmanship that existed among metalworkers at this time. Depicted are four spiders sitting in their web. The openwork, lacelike quality of the object was achieved by fusing the many minute parts together to create a symmetrical composition. The stylized spiders, their tiny eyes and fangs showing, are held, each in its own open space, by paired, spindly legs echoing the round bodies and joined to the web.;;Spider imagery occurs in Peruvian art from the middle of the first millennium B.C. onward, suggesting that spiders played a role in early Andean mythology. The spiders' ability to catch and kill live prey associates them with sacrifice.

In the empire's final days, Nabopolassar (r. 625605 B.C.), who had been in Assyrian service, established a new dynasty with its capital in Babylon. During the reign of his son, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604562 B.C.), the Neo-Babylonian empire reached its peak. This was largely attributable to Nebuchadnezzar's ability as a statesman and general. He maintained friendly relations with the Medes in the east while vying successfully with Egypt for control of trade on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem.;During this period, Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building, transforming Babylon into a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city's gates and buildings.;The most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or &quot;House of the New Year's Festival.&quot; The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of Adad, the weather god, and Marduk. North of the gate the roadway was lined with glazed figures of striding lions. This relief of a lion, the animal associated with Ishtar, goddess of love and war, served to protect the street; its repeated design served as a guide for the ritual processions from the city to the temple. addl Two Panels with striding lions Date: ca. 604–562 B.C.

The mass descended gradually, the Chaldaeans propping it up with the beams. It was a moment of great anxiety. The drums and shrill pipes of the Kurdish musicians increased the din and confusion caused by the war-cry of the Arabs, who were half frantic with excitement. They had thrown off nearly all their garments; their long hair floated in the wind; and they indulged in the wildest postures and gesticulations as they clung to the ropes. The women had congregated on the sides of the trenches, and by their incessant screams, and by the ear-piercing tahlehl, added to the enthusiasm of the men.;The bull once in motion, it was no longer possible to obtain a bearing. The loudest cries could produce were lost in the crash of discordant sounds. Neither the hippopotamus-hide whips of the Cawasses, nor the bricks and clods of earth with which I endeavoured to draw attention from some of the most noisy of the group, were of any avail. Away went the bull, steady enough as long as supported by the props behind; but as it came nearer to the rollers. The beams could no longer he used. The cable and ropes stretched more and more. Dry from the climate, as they felt the strain, they creaked and threw out dust. Water was thrown over them, but in vain, for they all broke together when the sculpture was within four or five feet of the rollers. The bull was precipitated to the ground. Those who held the ropes' thus suddenly released, followed its example, and were rolling, one over the other, in the dust. A sudden silence succeeded to the clamour. I rushed into the trenches, prepared to find the bull in many pieces. It would be difficult to describe my satisfaction when I saw it lying precisely where I had wished to place it a","NA,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8356790635.jpg","-","_IGP6065","Chris Protopapas","Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York","Chris Protopapas: art,Chris Protopapas: justpentax,Chris Protopapas: museum,Chris Protopapas: pentax,Chris Protopapas: pentaxart,Chris Protopapas: newyorkcity,Chris Protopapas: pentaxk10d,Chris Protopapas: smcpda1855mmf3556,Chris Protopapas: visipix,Chris Protopapas: hindu,Chris Protopapas: goddess,Chris Protopapas: sculpture,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8362952591.jpg","-","Tomb","mayareyes","NA","mayareyes: statue,mayareyes: tomb,mayareyes: metropolitanmuseumofart,mayareyes: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8364008068.jpg","67.34","Andromeda and the Sea Monster","mayareyes","Domenico Guidi (1694)  addl Andromeda and the Sea Monster Domenico Guidi (Italian, 1625–1701) Date: 1694 Medium: Marble Accession Number: 67.34 On view in Gallery 548","mayareyes: statue,mayareyes: andromeda,mayareyes: andromedaandtheseamonster,mayareyes: domenicoguidi,mayareyes: guidi,mayareyes: metropolitanmuseumofart,mayareyes: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8364010172.jpg","-","Und","mayareyes","NA","mayareyes: metropolitanmuseumofart,mayareyes: museum,mayareyes: nyc,mayareyes: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8367845916.jpg","-","_IGP6052","Chris Protopapas","The Spanish Courtyard, Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY","Chris Protopapas: metropolitanmuseumofart,Chris Protopapas: newyorkcity,Chris Protopapas: sculpture,Chris Protopapas: art,Chris Protopapas: pentax,Chris Protopapas: justpentax,Chris Protopapas: museum,Chris Protopapas: pentaxk10d,Chris Protopapas: pentaxart,Chris Protopapas: smcpda1855mmf3556,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8370564690.jpg","-","_IGP6061","Chris Protopapas","Sculpture, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City;;","Chris Protopapas: art,Chris Protopapas: justpentax,Chris Protopapas: pentaxk10d,Chris Protopapas: pentaxart,Chris Protopapas: pentax,Chris Protopapas: sculpture,Chris Protopapas: newyorkcity,Chris Protopapas: smcpda1855mmf3556,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8430611697.jpg","-","three","Marat Elkanidze","<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8430611697/in/photostream/lightbox/>www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8430611697/in/photostream/l...</a>","Marat Elkanidze: metropolitanmuseum,Marat Elkanidze: sculptures,Marat Elkanidze: beardedhercules,Marat Elkanidze: ,Marat Elkanidze: afrodite,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8433751039.jpg","-","NA","Marat Elkanidze","<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8433751039/in/photostream/lightbox/>www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8433751039/in/photostream/l...</a>","Marat Elkanidze: sculptures,Marat Elkanidze: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8436448475.jpg","1990.53.1","Autumn and Spring","Marat Elkanidze","<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8436448475/in/photostream/lightbox/>www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8436448475/in/photostream/l...</a>  addl Spring in the guise of Flora (one of a pair) Pietro Bernini (Italian, 1562–1629) Date: 1616–17 Medium: Marble Accession Number: 1990.53.1 On view in Gallery 534","Marat Elkanidze: springintheguiseofflora,Marat Elkanidze: pietrobernini,Marat Elkanidze: autumn,Marat Elkanidze: jeanbaptistepigalle,Marat Elkanidze: metropolitanmuseum,Marat Elkanidze: sculptures,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8438504221.jpg","-","memory","Marat Elkanidze","<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8438504221/in/photostream/lightbox/>www.flickr.com/photos/maratel/8438504221/in/photostream/l...</a>","Marat Elkanidze: gardenlandscape,Marat Elkanidze: louiscomforttiffany,Marat Elkanidze: memory,Marat Elkanidze: danielchesterfrench,Marat Elkanidze: metropolitanmuseum,Marat Elkanidze: sculptures,Marat Elkanidze: architecture,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 04","8451314555.jpg","-","Fingers of Artemis I","Joe Josephs: 1,355,720 views - thank you","MET Museum;Greek &amp;

They are typical of the architectural decoration found on Tarentine naiskoi (funerary monuments). On one, the figure of a sphinx is unusually large, leaving little of the original Corinthian acanthus-leaf design visible.
