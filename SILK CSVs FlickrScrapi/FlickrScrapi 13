Baker, 1914 (14.59) ;;Born in Ireland, William Orpen studied in Dublin from 1892 to 1896 and went to London for further study at the Slade School of Fine Art in 1896. For the rest of his life, he lived and worked in London. There he received a number of honors, including membership in the New English Art Club, a governmental appointment as an official war artist during World War I, and a knighthood in 1918. He continued to work as a fashionable portrait painter during the 1920s, portraying wealthy and prestigious sitters in a traditional, highly polished style that rejected more recent developments in avant-garde art. He also produced a number of realistic self-portraits, both before and after the war, including Myself and Cupid (1910, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh) and Ready to Start (1917, Imperial War Museum, London).;;This self-portrait, also known as Leading the Life in the West, refers to Orpen's life as a young artist in the West End of London. Orpen stands reflected full-length in a mirror in his studio, wearing a bowler hat and holding gloves and a riding crop. A shelf below the mirror holds paintbrushes and rags, the tools of the artist's trade, as well as several bottles of liquor. Various pieces of correspondence, including an I.O.U. signed by Orpen, are tucked behind the frame of the mirror, further testifying to the pleasures and distractions of the painter's early career. The space of the picture is shallow but complex, with Orpen using his skills as a draftsman to resolve the challenges of surface, lighting, and reflection that he has set for himself.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/14.59 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/14.59</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 13","6133463326.jpg","2008.551","Detail of The Three O'Clock Sitting by Matisse in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2010","ElissaSCA","Artist: Henri Matisse (French, Le ;Cateau-Cambresis 18691954 Nice);;Title: The Three O'Clock Sitting;;Date: 1924;;Medium: Oil on canvas;;Dimensions: 36 1/4 x 28 3/4 in.

(123.2 cm);Rogers Fund, 1914 (14.130.1);;The privilege of establishing a public portrait in Republican Rome was based primarily on social status acquired through political and military achievement. Hence, there were few, if any, representations of children. It was not until the advent of Augustus' new Golden Age that significant, imperial portraits of children began to be produced to underscore the dynastic aspirations, as well as the fecundity, of the Julio-Claudian family.;;This lifesize bronze statue of a boy wearing a Greek himation (cloak) may well represent Gaius, the adopted grandson of Emperor Augustus. The statue was found on the eastern Mediterranean island of Rhodes, whose ancient Greek cities were wealthy, flourishing centers of commerce and culture during the Roman period.;;The Romans considered works in bronze to be more prestigious than those made of marble, and bronze statues were common in the Roman period. However, lifesize bronzes are a rarity in modern collections because they were routinely melted down in the Middle Ages for their inherent metallic value. This notable example is part of a relatively small corpus of large-scale bronze portraits (05.30; 05.47)to have survived, and its quality attests to the superior artistic standards which ancient artists achieved.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/eusb/hod_14.130.1.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/eusb/hod_14.130.1.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: boy,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 13","1043627181.jpg","-","Mayan Idol","Keith Mac Uidhir  (Thanks for 2m views)","Mayan Idol, New York, USA","Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): new,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): york,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): usa,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): newyork,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): mayan,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): idol,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): statue,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): statuary,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): art,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): icon,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): museum,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): maya,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): pg,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): sculpture,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): religion,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): religious,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): traditional,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): ,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): northamerica,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): north,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): america,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): united,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): states,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): unitedstates,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): us,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): estados,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): unidos,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): spojene,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): staty,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): americke,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): vereinigte,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): staaten,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): etatsunis,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): amerikai,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): egyesult,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): allamok,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): amerika,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): serikat,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): stati,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): uniti,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): damerica,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): syarikat,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): verenigde,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): staten,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): stany,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): zjednoczone,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): statele,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): unite,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): ale,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): americii,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): birlesik,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): devletleri,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): hoa,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): ky,Keith Mac Uidhir (Thanks for 2m views): nueva,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 13","2102889697.jpg","03.23.1","Detail of the Front of the Etruscan Bronze Chariot in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Chariot, late 6th century B.C.;Etruscan; From Monteleone, Italy;Bronze; H. 51 1/2 in.
