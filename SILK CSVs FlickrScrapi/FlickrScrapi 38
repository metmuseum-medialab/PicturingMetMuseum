(Her mother came from a wealthy tobacco family, and her father had vast real-estate holdings.) Her interest in collecting was stimulated by her cousin John Wolfe. Soon after he commissioned a variant of Alexandre Cabanel's famous painting &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (hanging on the opposite wall), Catharine Wolfe commissioned several works from the fashionable French artist. This portrait, executed from sittings in Paris, is one of 143 paintings that Wolfe bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum in 1889a gift that, at the time, was heralded as one of the most important collections of contemporary art outside France.;;<i>This woman bears a striking resemblance to my Aunt Ana Marie.</i>","Maulleigh: portrait,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: new,Maulleigh: york,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: met,Maulleigh: catharine,Maulleigh: lorillard,Maulleigh: wolfe,Maulleigh: alexandre,Maulleigh: cabanel,Maulleigh: painting,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3312555887.jpg","-","Maude Adams as Joan of Arc","griannan",";;Photographer: Lisa O'Hara","griannan: loh,griannan: 2009,griannan: metmuseum,griannan: opalartseekers4,griannan: valentinesthemes,griannan: 1909,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:cat=1,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:org=metmuseum,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:team=opalartseekers4,erin_trying (Bklyn): num:metmuseum=2633,phat_matt_x: wla:phattmatt=2,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3312558213.jpg","-","Bouquet in a Chinese Vase","griannan",";;Photographer: Lisa O'Hara","griannan: loh,griannan: 2009,griannan: metmuseum,griannan: opalartseekers4,griannan: valentinesthemes,griannan: red,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:cat=1,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:org=metmuseum,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:team=opalartseekers4,erin_trying (Bklyn): num:metmuseum=64266,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3312938548.jpg","-","Head of Saint John the Baptist on a Charger","griannan",";;Photographer: Lisa O'Hara","griannan: loh,griannan: 2009,griannan: metmuseum,griannan: opalartseekers4,griannan: medievalart,griannan: malesaints,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3313366600.jpg","-","A Young Girl with Daisies","griannan",";;Photographer: Lisa O'Hara","griannan: loh,griannan: 2009,griannan: metmuseum,griannan: opalartseekers4,griannan: valentinesthemes,griannan: flowers,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:cat=1,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:org=metmuseum,erin_trying (Bklyn): wla:team=opalartseekers4,erin_trying (Bklyn): num:metmuseum=5821,@bastique: wla:bass=1,The Metropolitan Museum of Art: wla:caption=yes,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3315874773.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York City","ciuciak","&quot; face to face &quot;","ciuciak: timewemet,ciuciak: metropolitanmuseum,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3316674193.jpg","-","time_we_met","mar10tens","&quot;Jack at the Met&quot; by Irena Martens","mar10tens: timewemet,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3317506090.jpg","-","time_we_met","mar10tens","&quot;Jack at the Met&quot; by Irena Martens","mar10tens: timewemet,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3322731201.jpg","-","met","rosetry845","NA","rosetry845: timewemet,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3323564644.jpg","-","met","rosetry845","young love","NA,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3326027612.jpg","-","FIDEL","j.desmond82","NA","j.desmond82: ilovethisdirtytown,j.desmond82: nyc,j.desmond82: newyork,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3326066911.jpg","-","Couple","matisse1920","NA","matisse1920: met,matisse1920: museum,matisse1920: art,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 38","3326066921.jpg","-","Little Miss Jackson Pollock","matisse1920","This little girl got such of emotive reaction in front of this piece that yelled FANTASTIC!

In Roman times, Daphne was a popular holiday resort, used by the wealthy citizens and residents of Antioch as a place of rest and refuge from the heat and noise of the city. American excavations at Daphne in the late 1930s uncovered the remains of several well-appointed houses and villas, including the one that contained this mosaic. At the center is a panel (emblema) with the bust of a woman, decked out with a wreath of flowers around her head and a floral garland over her left shoulder. Traditionally identified as Spring, the figure is probably the representation of a more generic personification of abundance and good living, well situated to the luxurious atmosphere created at Daphne by its rich patrons.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: floor,ElissaSCA: mosaic,ElissaSCA: imperial,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,fresco_mosaic,Artwork","Fresco_Mosaic""SET 38","1525394330.jpg","1988.167","Candelabrum in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Candelabrum;From a service made for Graf Alexander Joseph Sulkowsky (1695-1762) and his wife Marie Anne Franziska von Stain (1712-41);Hard-paste porcelain;Model: Johann Joachim Kandler (1705-75), 1736;Meissen, 1736;;Accession # 1988.167;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: porcelain,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: german,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 38","2333313637.jpg","-","Mirror Image","Trish Mayo","NA","Trish Mayo: metropolitanmuseum,Trish Mayo: metropolitanmuseumofart,Trish Mayo: manhattan,Trish Mayo: newyork,Trish Mayo: museums,Trish Mayo: art,Trish Mayo: mirror,Trish Mayo: people,Trish Mayo: timewemet,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 38","2735924632.jpg","06.1021.167","Tondo Detail of a Kylix by the Painter of Bologna in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Terracotta kylix (drinking cup);Greek, Attic, red figure, ca. 460-450 BC;Attributed to the Painter of Bologna;Interior, Two schoolgirls;Exterior, women conversing;;Accession # 06.1021.167;;The representation in the tondo provides interesting evidence of the education of women in the mid-5th century BC.

(86.4 x 215.9 x 92.1 cm);Purchase, Joseph Pulitzer Bequest, 1955 (55.11.5);;This highly ornate and extremely well-preserved Roman marble sarcophagus came to the Metropolitan Museum from the collection of the dukes of Beaufort and was formerly displayed in their country seat, Badminton Hall in Gloucestershire, England. An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). The figures are unusual in that the Seasons are usually portrayed as women, but here they are shown as sturdy youths. Around these five central figures are placed other Bacchic figures and cultic objects, all carved at a smaller scale. On the rounded ends of the sarcophagus are two other groups of large figures, similarly intermingled with lesser ones. On the left end, Mother Earth is portrayed reclining on the ground; she is accompanied by a satyr and a youth carrying fruit. On the right end, a bearded male figure, probably to be identified with the personification of a river-god, reclines in front of two winged youths, perhaps representing two additional Seasons. The sarcophagus is an exquisite example of Roman funerary art, displaying all the virtuosity of the workshop where it was carved. Although the marble is Phrygian, from central Anatolia (Turkey), the stone was probably shipped to Rome and worked there. Only a very wealthy and powerful person would have been able to commission and purchase such a sarcophagus, and it was probably made for a member of one of the old aristocratic families in Rome itself. The subjects - the triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons - are unlikely, however, to have had any special significance for the deceased, particularly as it is clear that the design was copied from a sculptor's pattern book. Another sarcophagus, now in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Kassel, Germany, has the same composition of Dionysos flanked by the four Seasons, although the treatment and carving of the figures is quite different. On the Badminton sarcophagus the figures are carved in high relief and so endow the crowded scene with multiple areas of light and shade, allowing the eye to wander effortlessly from one figure to another. One must also imagine that certain details were highlighted with color and even gilding, making the whole composition a visual tour de force. Very few Roman sarcophagi of this quality have survived. Although the Badminton sarcophagus lacks its lid, the fact that it was found in the early eighteenth century and soon thereafter installed in Badminton Hall means that it has been preserved almost intact and only a few of the minor extremities are now missing. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=55.11.5>www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;vie...</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: challengeyouwinner,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 38","1186041842.jpg","55.11.5","The Badminton Sarcophagus in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Roman;Phrygian marble; Overall: 34 x 85 x 36 1/4 in.
