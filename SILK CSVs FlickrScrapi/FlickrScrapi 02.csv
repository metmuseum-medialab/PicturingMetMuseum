A trip to Italy in 1881-82 brought prolonged exposure to Renaissance art and led him to emphasize contours and modeling in his painting. He also began to abandon the notion that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture nuances of light and atmosphere. By the Seashore is thought to have been painted in the artists studio, where Renoirs model, Aline Charigot whom he married in 1890 posed in a wicker chair.

Back in New York, following his service in the army (ca. 195051), Johns became acquainted with artist Robert Rauschenberg, composer John Cage, and dancer Merce Cunningham. By the mid- to late 1950s Johns had already achieved fame with his paintings of targets, numerals, and American flags, and his work was exhibited in prominent museums and galleries in New York. &quot;White Flag&quot; of 1955, recently acquired by the Metropolitan from the artist's own collection, exemplifies Johns's early style, which engendered a wide range of subsequent art movements, among them Pop Art, Minimal Art, and Conceptual Art. During the 1950s and 1960s Johns frequently appropriated well-known images (such as targets, flags, and beer cans), elevating them to cultural icons. Throughout his oeuvre which includes painting, prints, drawings, and sculpture images are constantly recycled and combined in extensive series. In his later compositions of the 1970s, Johns filled the surface of his pictures with colorful cross-hatchings (suggested by the passing cars on an expressway); and since the 1980s he has incorporated images that have more autobiographical significance.;;&quot;White Flag&quot; is the largest of his flag paintings and the first in which the flag is presented in monochrome. By draining most of the color from the flag but leaving subtle gradations in tone, the artist shifts our attention from the familiarity of the image to the way in which it is made. &quot;White Flag&quot; is painted on three separate panels: the stars, the seven upper stripes to the right of the stars, and the longer stripes below. Johns worked on each panel separately. After applying a ground of unbleached beeswax, he built up the stars, the negative areas around them, and the stripes with applications of collage cut or torn pieces of newsprint, other papers, and bits of fabric. He dipped these into molten beeswax and adhered them to the surface. He then joined the three panels and overpainted them with more beeswax mixed with pigments, adding touches of white oil.;;The fast-setting medium of encaustic enabled Johns to make each brushstroke distinct, while the forty-eight-star flag design contiguous with the perimeters of the canvas provided a structure for the richly varied surface, which ranges from translucent to opaque.&quot;   addl White Flag Date: 1955 Medium: Encaustic, oil, newsprint, and charcoal on canvas Accession Number: 1998.329 On view in Gallery 922","andryn2006: art,andryn2006: jasperjohns,andryn2006: metropolitanmuseumofart,andryn2006: newyork,andryn2006: usa,andryn2006: unitedstates,American,Department,Art2or3,2D,Description,single,Artwork_number,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 02","13024906324.jpg","-","New York - Metropolitan Museum of Art","Allan482","Robert Lehman Collection","Allan482: newyork,Allan482: usa,Allan482: metmuseum,Allan482: museum,Allan482: fujixe1,Allan482: fujinon18mm,Allan482: fuji18mm,2D,Art2or3,multiple,Artwork_number,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 02","11881447734.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem.;During this period, Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building, transforming Babylon into a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city's gates and buildings.;The most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or &quot;House of the New Year's Festival.&quot; The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of Adad, the weather god, and Marduk. North of the gate the roadway was lined with glazed figures of striding lions. This relief of a lion, the animal associated with Ishtar, goddess of love and war, served to protect the street; its repeated design served as a guide for the ritual processions from the city to the temple. addl Two Panels with striding lions Period: Neo-Babylonian Date: ca. 604–562 B.C.

Michael Paul Foundation Inc. Gift and Charles Ulrick and Josephine Bay Foundation Inc. Gift, and Fletcher Fund, 1967 (67.250);;Dante's Divine Comedy has always enjoyed favor in the plastic arts. Ugolino, the character that galvanized peoples' fantasies and fears during the second half of the nineteenth century, appears in Canto 33 of the Inferno. This intensely Romantic sculpture derives from the passage in which Dante describes the imprisonment in 1288 and subsequent death by starvation of the Pisan count Ugolino della Gherardesca and his offspring. Carpeaux depicts the moment when Ugolino, condemned to die of starvation, yields to the temptation to devour his children and grandchildren, who cry out to him:;But when to our somber cell was thrown;A slender ray, and each face was lit;I saw in each the aspect of my own,;For very grief both of my hands I bit,;And suddenly from the floor arising they,;Thinking my hunger was the cause of it,;Exclaimed: Father eat thou of us, and stay;Our suffering: thou didst our being dress;In this sad flesh; now strip it all away.;Carpeaux's visionary composition reflects his reverence for Michelangelo, as well as his own painstaking concern with anatomical realism. Ugolino and His Sons was completed in plaster in 1861, the last year of his residence at the French Academy in Rome. A sensation in Rome, it brought Carpeaux many commissions. Upon his return to France, Ugolino was cast in bronze at the order of the French Ministry of Fine Arts and exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1863. Later it was moved to the gardens of the Tuilieries, where it was displayed as a pendant to a bronze of the Laocoon. This marble version was executed by the practitioner Bernard under Carpeaux's supervision and completed in time for the Universal Exposition at Paris in 1867. The date inscribed on the marble refers to the original plaster model's completion.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl  addl Ugolino and His Sons Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (French, Valenciennes 1827–1875 Courbevoie) Date: 1865–67 Medium: Saint-Béat marble Accession Number: 67.250 On view in Gallery 999","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: canonpowershota460,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,Roman,Department,3D,Art2or3,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,single,Artwork_number,partial,Framing,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 02","4692303192.jpg","-","Met Museum of Art, NY","dok1969","NA","NA,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,single,Artwork_number,partial,Framing,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 02","4692299026.jpg","1989.407","Met Museum of Art, NY","dok1969","The Burghers of Calais.  addl The Burghers of Calais Auguste Rodin (French, Paris 1840–1917 Meudon) Date: modeled 1884–95, cast 1985 Medium: Bronze Accession Number: 1989.407 On view in Gallery 548","NA,3D,Art2or3,single,Artwork_number,partial,Framing,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 02","4692295520.jpg","1993.11.1","Met Museum of Art, NY","dok1969","NA  addl Marble sarcophagus lid with reclining couple Date: ca.

The inspiration for his full-size seated nude was drawn from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; (1855), a popular wellspring of themes for American artists during the late nineteenth century. Saint-Gaudens represented the central protagonist, a Chippewa chief, as a contemplative figure seated on a rock, leaning against a tree trunk with his quiver of arrows and bow nearby, and &quot;Pondering, musing in the forest / On the welfare of his people,&quot; as the excerpt from Longfellow's poem inscribed on the marble base declares. Saint-Gaudens vowed he would &quot;astonish the world&quot; with his ambitious early piece, and, indeed, he sold the unique marble to Edwin D. Morgan, a former governor of New York.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl  Hiawatha Augustus Saint-Gaudens (American, Dublin 1848–1907 Cornish, New Hampshire) Date: 1871–72, carving 1874 Medium: Marble Accession Number: 2001.641 On view in Gallery 700","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,American,Department,3D,Art2or3,multiple,Artwork_number,one-focal,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 02","4265944079.jpg","19.124","Lmetart-211","qpkarl","Augustus Saint-Gaudens (18481907);Amor Caritas;188098; this cast, 1918;Bronze, gilt;103 1/4 x 50 in.

The human figures are often repetitious of the same model, each displaying subtle variations in composition or in the dynamics of movement or tension within the figure. The dancers of the Paris Opera, disciplined to achieve and to maintain the difficult and often entirely unnatural movements of ballet, were ideal for Degas' purpose, one that required just such holding of complicated poses, allowing him to work from a living model.

Shrines of Upper and Lower Egypt, and Overseer of the Cabinet&quot; in early Dynasty 26. His tomb was a great shaft over sixty feet deep sunk into the desert and solid limestone bedrock in the Late Period cemetery that covers most of the area east of the Djoser complex at Saqqara. In a huge plain chamber at the bottom of the shaft, a rectangular rock core was left standing and hollowed out to house this anthropoid sarcophagus. When the tomb was excavated by the Egyptian government in 1902, the sarcophagus contained the remains of a badly decomposed gilded cedar coffin, and a mummy that wore a mask of gilded silver, gold finger and toe stalls, and numerous small amulets. Other canopic and shabti equipment accompanied the burial. The finds went to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, while this sarcophagus was purchased from the Egyptian government by the Metropolitan Museum.;The sarcophagus is one of a group with plump, squarish broad faces, smooth unarticulated bodies, and slightly protruding feet that all originate in the Memphite area and date to the time around the reign of Psamtik II (ca. 595589 B.C.); several of them may have been produced by the same workshop. Technically the sarcophagus is one of the masterpieces of late Egyptian hard-stone carving. The interiors of the extraordinarily rendered sunk-relief hieroglyphs and figures were left rough and may have been intended to be painted, perhaps in green. The long text on the lid comes from the Book of the Dead.&quot;  addl  Sarcophagus of Harkhebit Date: 664–525 B.C.

(See below). The comparison is very interesting. First of all, the film/scanner combination got the color temperature mostly correct (a touch warm/yellow perhaps) while the digital camera's auto white balance got the color all &quot;wrong&quot;. This is of course a function of the automatic features of the respective softwares. In either case I could have manipulated the process to yield totally different results. The museum's mix of daylight and artificial light fooled the digital camera, but not the film/scanner combination.;;Shooting at ISO 200, the digital camera has the clear advantage in sharpness, mostly due to the image-stabilization that is absent in the film camera. The modern (circa 2007) zoom lens is also probably sharper wide open than the 30-year-old zoom lens on the film camera.;;The comparative &quot;quality&quot; of the images is hard to pin down. I really do feel that the film image has a more natural &quot;photographic&quot; look to it than the digital capture, which seems slightly &quot;artificial&quot; to me.

Originally this view was the living room of the summer residence of Frances W. Little and outside the windows on the left was Lake Minnetonka in Wayzata, Minnesota. Now the sunlight that enters this Frank Lloyd Wright interior design is filtered through Central Park in Manhattan. ;;I dont think the phrase organic architecture that is often heard by guides at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is about the use of natural materials. It is worth noting that this room was designed in a time when inorganic was a common choice. Furniture with artificial ingredients had become common, electric lighting played a part in the design and the telephone in the corner made this getaway not nearly as far away as previous vacation homes.;;As Amanda Peck said in Modern Living <a href='http://82nd-and-fifth.metmuseum.org/modern-living' rel='nofollow'>The room is so permeable that you are almost outdoors. So while you feel protected and safe you also are almost in a large tent in the woods.</a> Organic architecture seems less about the earth tones of ocher plaster walls, natural oak trim and more about the overall relationship this room offered to the natural surrounding. Something called Spatial Continuity, that the Met Museum page on this <a href='http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1972.60.1' rel='nofollow'>Living room from the Little House, Wayzata, Minnesota</a> describes as Frank Lloyd Wright's most important contributions to modern architecture. ;;Standing there in this Manhattan location and imagining the surrounding forest and a lake in the distance you can find all sorts of relationships, modern relationships. The way the vertical lines in the leaded glass must have danced with the trees outside, white birch Id imagine in Minnesota. The Mission Style furniture and subtle presence of the Arts and Crafts Movement must have been meant to relieve the stress of industrial life. Even the carpet feels earthy. ;;But now looking at this room with the one hundredth anniversary of its creation rapidly approaching, viewing what getting away from it all was like back then, it seems that in some areas of this rapidly chaining world, one hundred years ago can seem brand spanking new.  addl accession","Eddie C3: newyorkcity,Eddie C3: art,Eddie C3: metropolitanmuseum,Eddie C3: metropolitanmuseumofart,Eddie C3: franklloydwright,Eddie C3: architecture,Eddie C3: periodrooms,3D,Artwork,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,Period_Rooms,Space,period_room","Period_Room""SET 02","12228458664.jpg","-","USA-NYC-MET-European Decorative Arts","fbflickr","NA","fbflickr: usa,fbflickr: new,fbflickr: nyc,fbflickr: york,fbflickr: manhattan,fbflickr: metropolitan,fbflickr: museum,fbflickr: art,3D,Artwork,Period_Rooms,Space,furniture,decorative_object","Decorative_Object""SET 02","11593352805.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","__crs","new york city","__crs: newyork,__crs: ny,__crs: nyc,__crs: thecity,__crs: newyorkcity,__crs: manhattan,__crs: themet,__crs: themetnyc,__crs: themetnycmuseum,__crs: themetropolitanmuseumofart,__crs: wwwmetmuseumorg,__crs: metropolitanmuseumofart,__crs: fifthavenue,__crs: fifthavenuenyc,__crs: 5thave,__crs: 5thavenue,interior,Space,Inhabited,Other,architecture,Artwork","Architecture""SET 02","10917783213.jpg","-","upload","lily_bart","NA","lily_bart: instagramapp,lily_bart: square,lily_bart: squareformat,lily_bart: iphoneography,lily_bart: uploaded:by=instagram,Non_Art,non_art,Artwork","Non_Art"
