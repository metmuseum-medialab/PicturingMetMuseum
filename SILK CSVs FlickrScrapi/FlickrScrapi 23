It was taken by Augustus from Heliopolis soon after the annexation of Egypt in 30 BC. It was placed at the eastern end of the spin of the Circus as a monument to the conquest of Egypt and a dedication to the sun.;The second obelisk (15 century bc) stands by the basilica of San Giovanni in the Lateran (Rome). It is the tallest obelisk in Rome, reaching 45.7m (about 150ft) including pedestal and decoration. ;These two obelisks are the tallest still standing in Rome.;And... the basilica of San Giovanni in the Lateran, is the Pope's basilica.;Now, since obelisks are sun worshipping artifacts, plainly pagan objects; how is it that the Pope, in Rome would have a Pagan object, right in front of his basilica?;Well...;Actually if you do a little research, you'll find that the Roman Catholic Church, is basically the continuation of Paganism; and sun worshipping is alive and well at the Vatican.;;The obelisk brought to Rome from Alexandria by Caligula in AD 37 for the spina of the Circus of Caligula and Nero (Gaius and Nero) -a different Circus than Circus Maximus-, was carried by a ship described by Pliny as &quot;the most amazing thing that had ever been seen at sea&quot;;It is at the Circus of Gaius and Nero that St. Peter's Basilica is presently located.;;Ammianus Marcellinus: In AD 357, &quot;He (Constantius II) tore it from its foundations, but then let it lie for a long period on the ground while the necessary preparations were being made for its transport.

There it was placed on a sledge, slowly dragged through the Ostian Gate and the Piscina Publica, and brought into the Circus Maximus. It only remained to set it upright, a task which seemed almost, if not totally, impossible. [Dangerously tall masts were erected], which gave the impression of a forest of beams. To these were attached long, stout ropes which formed a network so dense it hid the sky.

(135.6 x 180.3 cm);Bequest of Florene M. Schoenborn, 1995 (1996.403.10);;Born in Greece to Italian parents, Giorgio de Chirico received his first drawing lessons at the Polytechnic Institute in Athens in 1900. In 1906, the family moved to Munich, where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, becoming acquainted with the magic realism of Swiss-German painter Arnold Bocklin and the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who encouraged the artist to &quot;refute reality.&quot; At various important junctures in his career, de Chirico lived in Paris (191115, 192532), as well as the United States (193638), but he spent most of his life in Italy. In Ferrara in 1917, he met the artist Carlo Carra, with whom he articulated a &quot;metaphysical&quot; style of painting in which an illogical reality seemed credible. Although the Metaphysical School was short-lived, its ramifications were felt in subsequent art movements, such as Dada and Surrealism.;;This composition presents one of the artist's famous deserted public squares. Somber monolithic arches on the right cast heavy geometric shadows, while on the left is a statue of the sleeping Ariadne. The statue, a Roman copy of a lost Hellenistic sculpture of Ariadne asleep on the island of Naxos after being abandoned by Theseus, had great symbolic meaning for de Chirico, perhaps because it evoked the classical past of his native Greece. In a series of five paintings, all from 1913, Ariadne is depicted from various angles, horizontally, vertically, and in partial close-up. Such early paintings, with their magical dreamlike qualities, were greatly admired by the Surrealists.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eust/ho_1996.403.10.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eust/ho_1996.403.10.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: dechirico,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","4730374988.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

The models were probably Monets father Adolphe, in the foreground; Monets cousin Jeanne Marguerite Lecadre at the garden fence; Dr. Adolphe Lecadre, her father; and perhaps Lecadres other daughter, Sophie, the woman seated in the foreground with her back to the viewer. Although this scene projects affluent domesticity, it is by no means a family portrait. Monets relations with his father were tense that summer, owing to family disapproval of the young artists liaison with his companion, Camielle Doncieux. ;;Monet called this work the Chinese painting in which there are flags; Renoir referred to it as the Japanese painting with little flags. In the 1860s, the compositions flat horizontal bands of color would have reminded sophisticated viewers of Japanese color wood-block prints, which were avidly collected by Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler, and others in their circle. The print by the Japanese artist Hokusai that may have inspired this picture remains today at Monets house at Giverny.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label. ;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: monet,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: impressionism,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193246137.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193248011.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193846976.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193848830.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193850490.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193852036.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193853674.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5193855408.jpg","-","NYC - The Met","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: themetropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: themet,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: fifthavenue,christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: gothamist,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5205686696.jpg","-","Still Life with Apples and Pears","John Elmslie","Paul Cezanne, ca. 1891-92.

Both the plaque and the elaborate frame pay homage to the flourishing of the decorative arts that took place during the French Renaissance. The scene on the plaque, by Nicolas-Marie Moriot after a painting by Charles Alexandre Debacq (18041853), portrays the Renaissance pottery Bernard Palissy burning the furniture in his house to fire his kiln. The oval enamel-on-copper plaques that decorate the frame depict events from Palissy's life, and their grisaille decoration evokes Limoges enamels of the sixteenth century. The plaques were painted by Jacob Meyer-Heine, who was named head of the recently established enamel workshop at Sevres in 1840. The dragons entwined with strapwork on the gilt-bronze frame by Armande Feuchere are drawn from the architectural vocabulary of the French Renaissance, and the biscuit porcelain figures modeled by Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann (18101867) recall the stucco decoration of the Galerie Francois I at Fontainebleau, the supreme example of Renaissance art in France.

Schoenborn, 1995 (1996.403.10);;Born in Greece to Italian parents, Giorgio de Chirico received his first drawing lessons at the Polytechnic Institute in Athens in 1900. In 1906, the family moved to Munich, where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, becoming acquainted with the magic realism of Swiss-German painter Arnold Bocklin and the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who encouraged the artist to &quot;refute reality.&quot; At various important junctures in his career, de Chirico lived in Paris (191115, 192532), as well as the United States (193638), but he spent most of his life in Italy. In Ferrara in 1917, he met the artist Carlo Carra, with whom he articulated a &quot;metaphysical&quot; style of painting in which an illogical reality seemed credible. Although the Metaphysical School was short-lived, its ramifications were felt in subsequent art movements, such as Dada and Surrealism.;;This composition presents one of the artist's famous deserted public squares. Somber monolithic arches on the right cast heavy geometric shadows, while on the left is a statue of the sleeping Ariadne. The statue, a Roman copy of a lost Hellenistic sculpture of Ariadne asleep on the island of Naxos after being abandoned by Theseus, had great symbolic meaning for de Chirico, perhaps because it evoked the classical past of his native Greece. In a series of five paintings, all from 1913, Ariadne is depicted from various angles, horizontally, vertically, and in partial close-up. Such early paintings, with their magical dreamlike qualities, were greatly admired by the Surrealists.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eust/ho_1996.403.10.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eust/ho_1996.403.10.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: dechirico,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: italian,2D,Art2o3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 23","5277545231.jpg","1980.3","Still Life with Flowers and Fruit by Fantin-Latour in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2009","ElissaSCA","Artist: Henri Fantin-Latour (French, 18361904);;Title: Still Life with Flowers and Fruit;;Date: 1866;;Medium: Oil on canvas;;Dimensions: 28 3/4 x 23 5/8 in.

A glaze is a layer of glass over a ceramic body. The first objects with a glazed surface were small beads and amulets made of faience, dating to the Ubaid period of the mid-sixth millennium B.C. While isolated examples of true glass beads have been found in contexts of the third millennium B.C., glass was produced on a large scale for the first time around 1600 B.C., perhaps in the Mitanni state of northern Mesopotamia.;This large jarglazed in green, blue, brown, yellow, white, and blackrepresents an advanced glazing technique that was in widespread use during the first millennium B.C. Its shoulder is decorated with a wreath of petals, and its body by bulls kneeling before trees. It is one of three jars in the Museum's collection that reportedly were found at the early first millennium B.C. site of Ziwiye in northwestern Iran, but it is also similar in shape and decoration to examples excavated at the Assyrian city of Ashur on the Tigris River in northern Iraq. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=55.121.2 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;view...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: jar,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: ceramic,3D,Art2o3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 23","2092945705.jpg","40.11.3 a,b","Etruscan Bronze Cinerary Urn with a Lid in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Bronze cinerary urn with lid;Etruscan, Campanian, ca. 500 BC;Said to be from Capua;;Accession # 40.11.3 a,b;;Large hammered-bronze urns, often with solid-cast figures on the lid, were frequently used for cremated remains in Etruscan dominated Campania.

The front of the shield shows the image of a standing nude male figure who is adorned with a white headband, the same as those worn by Hellenistic dynasts. This small male figure has been described as a reflected image on the shield, a popular motif in Hellenistic art. However, since there is no image in the fresco cycle that corresponds to a reflection, the figure should be understood as an apparition, which, in antiquity, was viewed as prophetic. The small apparition with a portraitlike head in this particular fresco may refer to a Hellenistic royal heir, and the woman bearing the shield may represent a priestess or prophetess.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cubi/hod_03.14.7.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cubi/hod_03.14.7.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: woman,ElissaSCA: shield,ElissaSCA: villa,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: fresco,DescriptionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2o3,fresco_mosaic,Artwork","Fresco_Mosaic""SET 23","2116049294.jpg","03.14.6","Man and Woman Seated Side by Side Wall Painting from the Villa of P.

(175.3 x 193 cm);Rogers Fund, 1903 (03.14.6);;This fresco panel from Boscoreale depicts a man and woman seated side by side. To the right is the heroic figure of a semi-nude man lounging on an elaborate, gilded chair. A dark-colored himation is loosely draped across his loins. Unfortunately, damage to the fresco has obliterated the upper part of the man's head, which was turned in profile toward the woman seated to his right. He rests his hands on a short gilded staff firmly set on the ground in front of him. Most likely this is a scepter, an ancient symbol of regal power that was also an attribute of Zeus, ruler of the Olympian gods. For Hellenistic dynasts, the scepter retained a strong meaning of justice. The late third-century B.C. philosopher Theophrastus advised that 'the true king should rule by the scepter and not the spear&quot; (Peri basileias II).;;To the left is a seated woman wearing a chiton and a himation that is drawn up over the back of her head. She rests her feet on a gilded footstool, and leans her chin on her hand in a gesture of reflection. Based on stylistic comparisons with other works of art, it has been suggested that the seated figures represent Achilles and his mother Thetis. For the spectator in antiquity, the woman's melancholy countenance and the gesture with her right hand may have been read as expressions of Thetis' concern or grief at the fate of her only son. More recently, however, it has been suggested that the woman represents the wife of the seated Hellenistic ruler to her left. As Roman aristocrats greatly admired Alexander the Great and the first generation of his successors, this seated ruler may be a dynast of the early Hellenistic period. The inclusion of this panel and the others that once adorned Room H of the villa at Boscoreale would have created a majestic interior that had particular relevance to political life in Rome during the time the villa was decorated, sometime between 60 and 30 B.C. This period in Roman history witnessed a series of great military rulersPompey the Great, Julius Caesar, and Marc Antonyall of whom were viewed as latter-day Alexanders who eventually would conquer the East for Rome.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cubi/hod_03.14.6.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cubi/hod_03.14.6.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: boscoreale,ElissaSCA: villa,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: fresco,3D,Art2o3,fresco_mosaic,Artwork","Fresco_Mosaic""SET 23","4596253078.jpg","32.130.7","Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2010","ElissaSCA","Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England;Steel, blackened, etched, and gilt; textile and leather;Italian (Milan or Brescia), about 1544;;Accession # 32.130.7;;This impressive armor was made for Henry VIII (r. 1509-1547) toward the end of his life when he was overweight and crippled with gout. Constructed for use on horse and on foot it was probably worn by the king during this last military campaign, the siege of Boulogne in 1544, which he commanded personally in spite of his infirmities. The harness was originally fitted with a detachable reinforcing breastplate, to which a lance-rest was attached, and a reinforce for the left pauldron (shoulder defense). A pair of exchange vambrances (arm defenses) remain in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle.;;The armor is described in the post mortem inventory of the king's possessions, drawn up in 1547, as &quot;of italian makinge.&quot; It was possibly supplied by a Milanese merchant known in England as Francis Albert, who was licensed by Henry to import luxury goods, including armor, into England for sale. The armor was subsequently given to William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, Henry's esquire and an executor of his will. It is recorded at Wilton House, seat of the Pembroke family, from 1558 until it was sold in the 1920s. By the end of the eighteenth century, and until very recently, the armor was erroneously identified as having belonged to Anne de Montmorency (1493-1567), Constable of France, its royal English origins having been forgotten.;;The armor is an early example of the &quot;anime&quot; type, in which the breastplate and backplate are constructed of horizontal overlapping plates connected and made flexible by rivets and internal leather straps. The decoration, consisting of foliage, putti, running dogs and Renaissance candelabra and grotesque ornament, is typically Italian.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: armor,ElissaSCA: henryviii,ElissaSCA: king,ElissaSCA: renaissance,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: english,Description,DescriptionInDesc,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2o3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 23","4762874530.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

(35.2 x 13.7 x 1 cm);Gift of J. Pierpont Morgan, 1917 (17.190.53);;Justinian, who would be the greatest emperor of the early Byzantine period, presented these handsome ivory panels to a member of the Roman senate announcing his election as consul. The title, now largely honorific, was once that of the supreme magistrate of the Roman Republic. Once hinged together with the names of the other consuls inscribed in wax on the interior, they were probably presented as an invitation to the great public games that the new consuls hosted in Constantinople's hippodrome (stadium). The elegantly carved classical motifs focus attention on the inscriptions written in Latin, still the official language of the Empire. Justinian was appointed consul for the East in 521, six years before he became emperor. To celebrate his appointment, he had diptychs, including this one, made for presentation to members of the Senate. Such ivory diptychs were popular in the early Byzantine Empire. This refined, simply carved example announces Justinian's appointment in Latin at the top of each wing, with a running inscription addressed to the senators in an elaborately bordered medallion in the center of each wing. At the four corners of each wing, lions' heads emerge from the centers of lush acanthus leaves. The soft, tactile quality of the acanthus stands in marked contrast to the abstract decorative medallions. In comparison with other consular diptychs, this example is relatively plain, since it was given to members of the Senate: higher government officials would have received more elaborately carved examples. The fact that three such diptychs presented by Justinian survive is certainly due to the subsequent political importance of the man whose consulship they proclaim. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=17&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=17.190.53 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=17&amp;vie...</a> and <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=17&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=17.190.53 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=17&amp;vie...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: lateantique,ElissaSCA: ivory,ElissaSCA: diptych,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: inscription,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: latin,3D,Art2o3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 23","2103731756.jpg","1990.247","Marble Statue of Dionysos Leaning on an Archaistic Female Figure in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","The Hope Dionysos, late 1st century A.D., with 18th-century restoration by Vincenzo Pacetti; Imperial;Roman;Marble; H. 82 1/4 in. (210.2 cm);Gift of The Frederick W. Richmond Foundation, Judy and Michael Steinhardt and Mr. and Mrs. A. Alfred Taubman, 1990 (1990.247);;This monumental marble statue was named the Hope Dionysos after its former owner, Thomas Philip Hope. The figure of Dionysos is shown standing at ease with his left arm resting on an archaistic female figure traditionally identified as Spes, the personification of hope. He wears a panther skin over his chiton and a cloak wrapped around his upper right arm and shoulder. Part of the cloak trails down the right side and part of it loops around the back of the god and over the head of the archaistic support.;;The archaistic female figure stands frontally with her feet together on a base that has been restored as a roughly hewn, blocklike pedestal. With her left hand, she pulls the lower part of her garment to one side. Her right arm, bent and extended toward the viewer, is restored as holding the bud of a lotus blossom. She wears a long, diagonal himation and a floor-length chiton. The heavy central pleat down the front of her himation and the V-folds near her neckline are retrospective elements, specifically archaistic, which look back to Archaic korai. Her coiffure consists of drilled Archaic snail-like curls over wavy hair that is parted down the middle, and two long spiral tresses that fall over each shoulder. Her facial features, however, recall those of sculpture dated to the first quarter of the fifth century B.C. (the Severe style), more than those of sculpture dated to the Archaic period. The figure's costume, hairstyle, and particularly her pose recall representations of Spes, who is usually depicted as a kore in an archaistic himation, holding a bud, either open or closed, in her right hand.;;The torso and head of Dionysos, and most of the archaistic figure are Roman. However, the head was joined to the torso by the sculptor and restorer Vincenzo Pacetti, who also provided arms, lower legs, and other details to complete the composition.

Alfred Taubman, 1990 (1990.247);;This monumental marble statue was named the Hope Dionysos after its former owner, Thomas Philip Hope. The figure of Dionysos is shown standing at ease with his left arm resting on an archaistic female figure traditionally identified as Spes, the personification of hope. He wears a panther skin over his chiton and a cloak wrapped around his upper right arm and shoulder. Part of the cloak trails down the right side and part of it loops around the back of the god and over the head of the archaistic support.;;The archaistic female figure stands frontally with her feet together on a base that has been restored as a roughly hewn, blocklike pedestal. With her left hand, she pulls the lower part of her garment to one side. Her right arm, bent and extended toward the viewer, is restored as holding the bud of a lotus blossom. She wears a long, diagonal himation and a floor-length chiton. The heavy central pleat down the front of her himation and the V-folds near her neckline are retrospective elements, specifically archaistic, which look back to Archaic korai. Her coiffure consists of drilled Archaic snail-like curls over wavy hair that is parted down the middle, and two long spiral tresses that fall over each shoulder. Her facial features, however, recall those of sculpture dated to the first quarter of the fifth century B.C. (the Severe style), more than those of sculpture dated to the Archaic period. The figure's costume, hairstyle, and particularly her pose recall representations of Spes, who is usually depicted as a kore in an archaistic himation, holding a bud, either open or closed, in her right hand.;;The torso and head of Dionysos, and most of the archaistic figure are Roman. However, the head was joined to the torso by the sculptor and restorer Vincenzo Pacetti, who also provided arms, lower legs, and other details to complete the composition.

Religious cults were revived, temples were built, public ceremonies and sacrifices filled the calendar. Men of every rank chose to be portrayed in the act of pious sacrifice. The popular type of sculpture seen here showed young boys who served as acolytes at religious ceremonies.;;The identification of this figure as a camillus, an attendant at sacrifices who was chosen from the noblest families, is based on comparisons with other stages and reliefs, most notably those of the famous monument, the Ara Pacis of Augustus. According to Roman tradition, a camillus had to be below the age of puberty, and both parents must be alive. This statue may have been dedicated at a sanctuary by the boy's parents, in recognition of his service to the gods. Alternatively, its refined decorative qualities may signal its use as an adornment within a religious precinct, for instance in a dining room for priests. ;;The figure's eyes are inlaid with silver, the lips with copper, and the tunic with strips of copper to suggest woven or embroidered bands of color.

(96.5 x 68.6 cm);Rogers Fund, 1919 (19.186);;Buddhist images executed in dry lacquer were highly valued by the Chinese because of their costly and time-consuming process of production. There are so few surviving examples that this seated Buddha is especially precious. To fashion the body of the image, the craftsman made a rough form of the sculpture in clay and then applied at least three layers of hemp cloth, each secured with a paste made of raw lacquer (the sap from the lac tree, Rhus verniciflua) and a fine powder of bone, horn, shell, ceramic, stone, or carbon. Each layer had to dry thoroughly before the next could be added. The clay core was then removed from the lacquered image. The head and hands were likely modeled separately, using the same technique as that used for the body, and then attached to the sculpture. The surface was finished with several coatings of pure lacquer and then painted.;;Portrayed as a youthful figure, the Buddha sits in the full lotus position, with his legs tightly interlocked, though the lower part of the sculpture is missing. The position of the damaged arms suggests that the hands performed the gesture of contemplation. The columnar form and lean gracefulness of the figure recall the style of Buddhist sculpture of the late Period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386589), but the attempt to render anatomical differentiation and, in particular, the emotional impact of the Buddha's expression are distinguishing features of early Tang style. The traces of brilliant red and blue, vividly combined to form a stylized floral pattern in the hem of the undergarment crossing the chest, and the remains of shimmering gilt on the surface are evidence of the sumptuous effect of this once colorful figure.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2o3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 23","5274692831.jpg","1997.442.7.2","Standing Female Attendant in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, April 2009","ElissaSCA","Title/Object Name: Standing Female Attendant;;Culture: China;;Period: Tang dynasty (618907);;Date: late 7th centuryearly 8th century;;Medium: Wood with pigments;;Dimensions: H. 21 in.

(95.2 cm);Bequest of Mary Clark Thompson, 1923 (26.229);;Constantine was the first Christian emperor of Rome, and his reign had a profound effect on the subsequent development of the Roman, and later Byzantine, world. Constantine's reign marked a distinct shift away from the administrative system set up by the emperor Diocletian in 293 A.D., which saw the division of the empire into four territories each governed by one of four imperial partners. This Tetrarchy was founded on the idea of homogeneous authority; all four emperors were depicted together in portraits emphasizing their unity and indivisibility in order to bolster their strength and present the image of a unified empire. Although Diocletian's intent had been to permanently do away with dynastic succession, Constantine's aim was to establish a new dynasty and to found a new capital, named Constantinople after himself. He also succeeded in reunifying the empire with the defeat of the last of his former tetrarchic colleagues, the Eastern emperor Licinius.;;Although the court and administration no longer resided at Rome, Constantine was careful not to neglect the old imperial city and adorned it with many new secular and Christian buildings. The most famous of these is the triumphal arch, the Arch of Constantine, which still stands near the Colosseum. This work contains reused material from earlier monuments, a practice that was not only economical but probably also intended to shed reflected glory on the emperor by associating his reign in a very direct and practical way with that of famous &quot;good&quot; emperors from the past. This desire to link himself to his revered predecessors greatly influenced Constantine's official portraiture, and contributed to the revival of certain classicizing features that had been absent from imperial portraiture for over a century.;;The full breadth of Constantine's portraiture demonstrates a remarkable evolution: early coin portraits show him in the manner of the Tetrarchs with a stubble beard and blocky physique, while later portraits such as this one, made after his assumption of sole power, show a significant change. In an effort to disassociate himself from his immediate predecessors, Constantine adopted an official image that recalled the calm, youthful faces of Augustus and Trajan. This colossal portrait head once surmounted an enormous statue of the seated emperor, and displays many features characteristic of Augustan and Trajanic portraiture. Most notably, Constantine is clean-shaven and his cap of hair is thick and arranged in comma-shaped locks across his forehead (compare this with the portrait head of Augustus (07.286.115). As part of his plan to reorganize the empire, Constantine's portraiture offered a new iconography to match his new regime.;;This monumental head, as in smaller portraits and coins of Constantine, presents the emperor as detached from the real world. It lacks the intimacy and individual expressiveness of earlier imperial portraits. Constantine gazes into the far distance with his eyes lifted as if to heaven. The symbolism is clear and sets the stage for the iconography of the early Christian and Byzantine world, where the emperor was seen as God's regent on earth.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/eust/hod_26.229.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/eust/hod_26.229.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: constantine,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lateantique,3D,Art2o3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 23","5257195872.jpg","-","Metropolitan Museum of Art-NYC","Alex E.
