(38.4 x 55 cm);Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection, 1998 (1999.363.44);;Odalisques were the most popular subject of Matisse's Nice period, during the 1920s. They appear in diverse poses in innumerable canvases: reclining, lounging, seated, or standing, frequently with their arms raised or folded behind the head. Dressed or semi-dressed in exotic attire, they are placed against a decorative background of richly patterned fabrics and oriental rugs and surrounded by oriental accoutrements. Matisse's primary model for these depictions, from 1920 to 1927, was Henriette Darricarriere (born 1901), a young woman skilled in the arts of ballet, piano, violin, and painting who lived near Matisse's studio.;;In his third-floor apartment at 1, Place Charles-Felix, Matisse arranged an &quot;Oriental&quot; alcove, equipped with a low couch, mirrors, decorative screens, and profusely patterned wall hangings, creating an atmosphere of reverie and exoticism reminiscent of the Moorish interiors he had seen in Morocco. The model's sculpturesque body, languorously stretching on the couch, exudes sensuality and carnality, enhanced by the warm rosy red color scheme. The mood of &quot;luxe, calme et volupte&quot; is clearly palpable. Yet, contemplating the work, one gets the impression that the artist somehow distanced himself from the erotic content of the picture while leaving the excitement of recognition to the viewer. Despite their attempt at authenticity, the paintings appear carefully staged and full of theatricality. The theme of odalisques during Matisse's Nice period is central not only to his paintings, but also to his sculptures, drawings, and prints.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/ho_1999.363.44.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/ho_1999.363.44.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: matisse,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: odalisque,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 28","2878895786.jpg","1999.363.56","Boy in a Striped Sweater by Modigliani in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Amedeo Modigliani.

His stylizing brush wiped away the earlier round-cheeked youthfulness of the face, replacing it with a masklike expression of savy cunning.

Perls Collection, 1997;;Accession Number: 1997.149.9;;Description: ;;Born to a once-prosperous Jewish merchant family in Italy, Amedeo Modigliani grew up in a cultured but financially strained environment in Livorno. A severe bout of pleurisy ended his formal schooling at age fourteen, and he was plagued by poor health for the rest of his short life; he died of tuberculosis at age thirty-five. From 1902 to 1906 Modigliani studied painting with the Italian artist Guglielmo Micheli (a proponent of plein-air painting) and visited Capri, Naples, Florence, Venice, and Rome. In 1906 he moved permanently to Paris, where he frequented artists' gatherings and became friends with other expatriate artists living in France, such as Chaim Soutine and Moise Kisling. Modigliani was a prolific artist, producing some 420 paintings, innumerable drawings, and 31 sculptures between 1906 and 1920.;;His celebrated series of nudes continues the tradition of depictions of Venuses from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century but with one significant difference: the eroticism of the earlier figures is always couched within a mythological or anecdotal context, whereas Modigliani does away with this pretext. Consequently, his women appear unabashedly frank and provocative. ;;The artist is best known for the works that he created in Paris between 1915 and 1919 portraits, in which a few telling details achieve a striking likeness, and nudes. Modigliani began his great series of reclining women in 1916. The two dozen or so figures never his mistresses or friends but always professional models lie on a dark bed cover that accentuates the glow of their skin; they are seen close-up and usually from above. Their stylized bodies span the entire width of the canvas, and their hands and feet often remain outside the picture's frame. Sometimes asleep, they most often face the viewer, as does this gracefully built model in one of the artist's most famous paintings of the series;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern_art/reclining_nude_amedeo_modigliani/objectview.aspx?collID=21&amp;OID=210007063 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: modigliani,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 28","4565047222.jpg","1999.363.59","Self Portrait by Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2008","ElissaSCA","Artist: Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 18811973);;Title: Self-Portrait;;Date: 1906;;Medium: Oil on canvas mounted on honeycomb panel;;Dimensions: 10 1/2 x 7 3/4in.

He ignored still-life subjects during his yearlong hospital stay, but before leaving the artist brought his work in Saint-Remy full circle with four lush bouquets of spring flowers: two of roses and two of irises, in contrasting formats and color harmonies. Van Gogh noted that in the &quot;two canvases representing big bunches of violet irises,&quot; he placed &quot;one lot against a pink background&quot; and the other &quot;against a startling citron yellow background&quot; to exploit the play of &quot;disparate complementaries.&quot; Owing to the use of a fugitive red pigment, the &quot;soft and harmonious&quot; effect that he had sought in the Metropolitan's painting through the &quot;combination of greens, pinks, violets&quot; has been altered by the fading of the once pink background to almost white.

Matisse / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York;;Between 1905 and 1914, Matisse spent various summers and one winter in the small fishing village of Collioure on the Mediterranean coast, not far from the Spanish border. During his first summer there, his family initially lived in a small pension, &quot;La Mere Rosette,&quot; before moving into an apartment facing the harbor, from which he painted various window views. Then, from 1906 to 1914, the artist rented the upper floor of a small house complete with studio and skylight. From there it was only a seven-minute walk to the picturesque site above the rock (called &quot;Roca-Alta d'en Beille,&quot; Catalan for &quot;High Rock&quot;) from which Matisse often painted views of Collioure such as this one.;;By 1907, Matisse had developed the flat and decorative style that he had employed for the first time in 1906 in the The Young Sailor II (1999.363.41). The black lines that form a screen before the View of Collioure and the Sea are the trunks and branches of the umbrella pines that grow on the hillside overlooking the harbor. Encircling the areas of bright color painted in greens, blues, mauves, and earth tones, the sinuous lines resemble the leading around stained-glass windows; not surprisingly, the Matisse family referred to this painting as &quot;Le Vitrail&quot; (&quot;The Stained Glass&quot;), and it is often listed as such in early exhibition catalogues. Through the foliage is a distant view of several red-roofed houses, the tower of Collioure's church, and a horizontal band marking the division between the pink sky and deep-blue sea.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1999.363.42 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1999.363.42</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: matisse,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: landscape,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: modern,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 28","4573248095.jpg","51.30.3","Vetheuil in Summer by Monet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2008","ElissaSCA","Artist: Claude Monet (French, 18401926);;Title: Vetheuil in Summer;;Date: 1880;;Medium: Oil on canvas;;Dimensions: 23 5/8 x 39 1/4 in.

The French authorities banished the Capuchin order from the church of the Immaculate Conception, near the Piazza Barberini, even billeting troops there for a time. Nevertheless, this painting of the churchs interior was purchased by the emperors sister Caroline Murat, queen of Naples, for her brother Louis Bonaparte, who had seen it exhibited in the painters sudio, where it created a sensation at the end of 1814. Pius VII, the same pope who had been forced to preside over Napoleons coronation a decade earlier, asked to meet the artist as a result of the exhibition.

It was only in the Archaic period that stone sculptures were used as funerary monuments. On this magnificent krater, the main scene, which occupies the widest portion of the vase, shows the deceased laid upon a bier surrounded by members of his household and, at either side, mourners.

(3.8 cm); W. 3 in. (7.6 cm); L. 1 9/16 in. (4 cm);Gift of The Kronos Collections, 1981 (1981.398.3.4);;The place of these earrings in the history of Indian art is assured, not only for their intrinsic beauty but also because of the light they shed on the superb quality of goldsmithing early in this region. Early Indian statues of both male and female figures were usually portrayed wearing elaborate jewelry that sometimes seemed fanciful, since very little comparable jewelry from that period survives. The discovery of this pair of earrings provided the first tangible evidence that the jewelry depicted by sculptors was in fact based on real models, for a very similar pair is shown on a first century B.C. relief portrait of a &quot;Universal Ruler&quot; (chakravartin), from Jaggayapeta. These earrings, judging from their material worth, excellence of craftsmanship, and use of royal emblems (a winged lion and an elephant) as part of their design, were most probably made as royal commissions. Each earring is composed of two rectangular, budlike forms growing outward from a central, double-stemmed tendril. The elephant and the lion of repousse gold are consummately detailed, using granules, snippets of wire and sheet, and individually forged and hammered pieces of gold. The two pieces are not exactly identical: on the underside they are both decorated with a classical early Indian design of a vase containing three palmettes, but the patterning of the fronds differentiates them. They are so large and heavy that they must have distended the earlobes and rested on the shoulders of the wearer, like the pair worn by the &quot;Universal Ruler.&quot; ; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=6&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1&amp;item=1981.398.3%96.4 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=6&amp;view...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: earrings,ElissaSCA: indian,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 28","1563375657.jpg","52.120","Inlaid Wooden Panel in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Back Panels of Choir Stalls;;From choir stalls made by the cabinetmaker Johann Justus Schacht with the help of twenty-one assistants for the church of the Carthusian monastery in Mainz.;Panels: oak veneered with walnut, boxwood, rosewood, ebony, maple, and other woods, ivory, green-stained horn, and pewter. ;Figures: carved and painted limewood;Mainz, 1723-26, with additions from 1787;;Accession # 52.120;;After the secularization of the monastery in 1787 the choir stalls were sold to the cathedral in Trier.

It was found among the jewelry of Princess Sit-hathor-yunet in a special niche of her underground tomb beside the pyramid of Senwosret II at Lahun. Hieroglyphic signs make up the design, and the whole may be read: &quot;The god of the rising sun grants life and dominion over all that the sun encircles for one million one hundred thousand years [i.e., eternity] to King Khakheperre [Senwosret II].&quot;; ;This cloisonne pectoral is inlaid with 372 carefully cut pieces of semiprecious stones. The heraldic design is replete with symbolism. Zigzag lines on the base bar represent the primordial waters out of which the primeval hill emerged. Each of the falcons, symbols of the sun god, clasps a circular hieroglyph meaning &quot;encircled,&quot; thus declaring the solar deity's supreme power over the universe. The same hieroglyph, elongated to form a cartouche, encircles the throne name of Senwosret II, Khai-kheper-re. Flanking the king's name are two ankh hieroglyphs (meaning &quot;life&quot;) suspended from cobras whose tails are wound around the sun disk on the falcons' heads. These snakes represent Nekhbet and Udjo, the traditional protector goddesses of the king. Supporting the royal cartouche is the kneeling god Heh clutching two palm ribs symbolizing &quot;millions of years.&quot; Thus the king's life and existence in time are described as part of a universe created and sustained by the supreme sun god.; ;Jewelry worn by royal women during the Middle Kingdom was simply for adornment or an indication of status but was also symbolic of concepts and myths surrounding Egyptian royalty. Jewelry imbued a royal woman with superhuman powers and thus enabled her to support the king in his role as guarantor of divine order on earth. It was essentially the king who benefited from the magical powers inherent in the jewelry worn by the female members of his family, which explains why his name, rather than that of the princess, appears in the designs.; ;Since the tomb of the princess was beside the pyramid of Senwosret, scholars speculate that she was his daughter. Other items in the tomb bear the name of Amenemhat III, suggesting that the princess lived during the reigns of three of the most powerful rulers of Dynasty 12: Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/pectoral_and_necklace_of_sithathoryunet/objectview.aspx?page=1&amp;sort=5&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=1&amp;dd1=10&amp;dd2=31&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=31&amp;OID=100000450&amp;vT=1 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: cloisonne,3D,Art2or3,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 28","4050625527.jpg","1987.142.71a,b","Inscribed Reliquary in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2009","ElissaSCA","Inscribed Reliquary, Donated by King Indravarman;Pakistan (ancient region of Gandhara, Bajaur region), AD 5-6;Schist;;Accession #

Constructed for use on horse and on foot it was probably worn by the king during this last military campaign, the siege of Boulogne in 1544, which he commanded personally in spite of his infirmities. The harness was originally fitted with a detachable reinforcing breastplate, to which a lance-rest was attached, and a reinforce for the left pauldron (shoulder defense). A pair of exchange vambrances (arm defenses) remain in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle.;;The armor is described in the post mortem inventory of the king's possessions, drawn up in 1547, as &quot;of italian makinge.&quot; It was possibly supplied by a Milanese merchant known in England as Francis Albert, who was licensed by Henry to import luxury goods, including armor, into England for sale. The armor was subsequently given to William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, Henry's esquire and an executor of his will. It is recorded at Wilton House, seat of the Pembroke family, from 1558 until it was sold in the 1920s. By the end of the eighteenth century, and until very recently, the armor was erroneously identified as having belonged to Anne de Montmorency (1493-1567), Constable of France, its royal English origins having been forgotten.;;The armor is an early example of the &quot;anime&quot; type, in which the breastplate and backplate are constructed of horizontal overlapping plates connected and made flexible by rivets and internal leather straps.

In rural areas Egyptians still carry heavy loads on their heads, as do people in many parts of the world.;;This figure is larger than the others because she embodies the products of an entire estate that Meketre determined to be the source that would provide offerings for his funeral cult in perpetuity. Her size, broad collar necklace, bracelets, anklets, and dress indicate her importance. The patterns on her dress represent small feathers, and the vertical stripes of the underskirt, long wing feathers. Goddesses are frequently portrayed in similar costumes. Here the dress probably refers to Isis or Nephthys, both of whom protected the dead in the afterlife. Interestingly, because the action of offering is important, offering women may stride - a pose usually reserved for men. The companion figure in Cairo is dressed in a garment made of bead netting.;;Since this statue is made of wood, it must have been carved from the roughly cylindrical shape of a tree trunk, yet the squared base and the frontal, balanced pose conform to the rectilinear style of stone sculpture. Unlike the case in stone sculpture, however, in wooden figures the space between body and limbs is open, creating a more lifelike appearance. The colors and patterns, as well as the figure's large eyes and slender, subtly naturalistic form, are arresting. The gray-green color, especially on the wig but also on the garment, originally may have been blue, the hair color of deities.

The city-state of Lagash produced a remarkable number of statues of its kings as well as Sumerian literary hymns and prayers under the rule of Gudea (ca. 21502125 B.C.) and his son Ur-Ningirsu (ca. 21252100 B.C.).

Many inscribed with his name and divine dedications survive. Here, Gudea is depicted in the seated pose of a ruler before his subjects, his hands folded in a traditional gesture of greeting and prayer.

Harkness, 1917 (17.9.1);;This well-formed statuette of a hippopotamus demonstrates the Egyptian artist's appreciation for the natural world. It was molded in faience, a ceramic material made of ground quartz. Beneath the blue-green glaze, the body was painted with the outlines of river plants, symbolizing the marshes in which the animal lived.; ;The seemingly benign appearance that this figurine presents is deceptive. To the ancient Egyptians, the hippopotamus was one of the most dangerous animals in their world. The huge creatures were a hazard for small fishing boats and other rivercraft. The beast might also be encountered on the waterways in the journey to the afterlife. As such, the hippopotamus was a force of nature that needed to be propitiated and controlled, both in this life and the next. This example was one of a pair found in a shaft associated with the tomb chapel of the steward Senbi II at Meir, an Upper Egyptian site about thirty miles south of modern Asyut. Three of its legs have been restored because they were purposely broken to prevent the creature from harming the deceased. The hippo was part of Senbi's burial equipment, which included a canopic box (also in the Metropolitan Museum), a coffin, and numerous models of boats and food production.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/hippopotamus/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100000444 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: faience,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: figurine,ElissaSCA: hippo,ElissaSCA: blue,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 28","4048724449.jpg","1999.203","Plaque with a Standing Yakshi in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2009","ElissaSCA","Plaque with a Standing Yakshi ;India (West Bengal), Shunga period, 1st century BC;Wood;;Accession # 1999.203;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: wood,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: goddess,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: indian,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 28","4049483250.jpg","1987.142.376","Plaque with a Dancer and a Vina Player in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2009","ElissaSCA","Plaque with a Dancer and a Vina Player ;India (Uttar Pradesh, Kaushambi), Shunga period, 1st century BC;Terracotta;;Accession # 1987.142.376;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: plaque,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: musician,ElissaSCA: dancing,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: indian,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 28","4119956731.jpg","1995.539.14","Silver Statuette of Venus in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2009","ElissaSCA","Silver Statuette of Venus;Roman, 1st-2nd century AD;;Accession # 1995.539.14;;The Roman goddess Venus was early assimilated to the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite.
