Presiding over the scene of Creation is God the Father, bathed in a glowing celestial light as he is borne aloft by seraphim. Beside the &quot;mappamondo&quot; (map of the world) is the garden of Paradise, its four rivers issuing from the ground at the lower right. The garden's effulgent flora symbolize the pure and sinless state of man before the Fall. A diminutive Adam and Eve are expelled from the garden by a lithe angel whose unusual nakedness and human form may symbolize his deep compassion for the corrupted state of humankind after the fall from grace., , , , This panel was originally at the far left of the predella from Giovanni di Paolo's &quot;Guelfi Altarpiece&quot; formerly in the Church of San Domenico in Siena (now Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence).

(176.5 x 192.7 cm), Wentworth Fund, 1950 (50.70), , The protagonists in this elaborate allegory are the brothers Jean, Francois, Guillaume, and Gaucher de Dinteville, important members of the court of Francis I, king of France. Portrayed at a moment of crisis in their relations with the king, they participate in a narrative derived from Exodus 7:9. Moses and Aaron plead with Pharaoh to free the Israelites; to prove they are armed with the power of the Lord, Aaron changes his rod into a serpent. Depicted in the guise of Aaron is Francois II de Dinteville, bishop of Auxerre; his brother Jean is shown as Moses, and the younger brothers, Gaucher and Guillaume, stand behind them. The names and ages of the three latter brothers are inscribed on the hems of their robes. Pharaoh is a disguised portrait of Francis I. This painting hung in the Dinteville chateau of Polisy along with Holbein's Ambassadors (National Gallery, London). This fascinating allegory has stylistic affinities to the works of sixteenth-century Antwerp artistsin the emphatic gestures of the robed classical figures, in particular. The simplification and solidity of form, meanwhile, are more typical of French painting. Though the identity of the artist is unknown, the work represents a high level of technical accomplishment and suggests the hand of a Mannerist painter working in the circle of a Northern European court.","'Maulleigh: moses, Maulleigh: aaron, Maulleigh: before, Maulleigh: pharaoh, Maulleigh: an, Maulleigh: allegory, Maulleigh: dinteville, Maulleigh: family, Maulleigh: 1537,','Maulleigh: moses, Maulleigh: aaron, Maulleigh: before, Maulleig,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 30","4376447447.jpg","1983.486","Christmas-Time, The Blodgett Family, 1864","Maulleigh","Eastman Johnson (18241906), Title Christmas-Time, The Blodgett Family, Date1864, Medium Oil on canvas, Dimensions 30 x 25 in.

This scene, known as the Triumph of Fame and based on Boccaccio's Amorosa Visione (1342) and Petrarch's Trionfi (135474), clearly shows the dynastic ambitions of Piero de' Medici, Lorenzo's father, who commissioned the work and gave it to his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni. The tray must have had considerable commemorative value to Lorenzo, as it was hanging in his bedchamber at the time of his death., , Giovanni di Ser Giovanni Guidi, known as Lo Scheggia, was the younger brother of Masaccio, the short-lived revolutionary artist of the early quattrocento in Florence.

On the left, Zenobius meets a funeral procession and restores a dead youth to life.

In the right background, Saint Eugenius receives water and salt blessed by Zenobius and then hastens across the square to revive a dead relative with the water., , The panel probably formed part of the decoration of the meeting room of a Florentine confraternity. It has suffered from overcleaning., NotesThis is the third in a series of four panels depicting the life and miracles of Saint Zenobius, an early bishop and one of Florence's patron saints. The literary source is the life of the saint written by the priest Clemente Mazzo in 1475, who gives the life dates of the saint as 335/6424. The first two panels of the series are in the National Gallery, London, and the fourth is in the Gemaldegalerie, Dresden., , At left Saint Zenobius encounters a funeral procession and restores the dead youth to life.

The lowest of the three elevations is composed of eight pairs of tall, doubled windows surmounted by quatrefoils and a crocketed gable., , The architectural conceit well suits the function of the object, as the generous fenestrations allow air to fire the incense coals while providing an escape for the perfuming smoke. The four chains threaded through every other tower support the vessel; raising the fifth chain by the ring elevates the entire upper section, allowing for the addition of incense., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mgot/ho_17.190.360_av1.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mgot/ho_17.190.360_av1.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: medieval, ElissaSCA: sculpture, ElissaSCA: silver, ElissaSCA: censer, ElissaSCA: gothic, ElissaSCA: christian, ElissaSCA: middleages,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 30","4220473097.jpg","1995.330","Detail of Spring Stained Glass Window in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, June 2009","ElissaSCA","Spring;Daniel Cottier &amp; Company (1873-1915);New York City, ca. 1875-83;Stained and painted glass, lead;;Accession # 1995.330;;This window- one of a series of allegorical designs of the four seaons- epitomizes the style of the multi-talented Daniel Cottier (1838-1891), one of the most important British arists of the Aesthetic movement.

(32.5 cm), Gift of Stanley Herzman, in memory of Adele Herzman, 1991 (1991.253.4), , China's contacts with countries to the west reached a peak in the first half of the eighth century during the reign of the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 71256). Along the trade routes crossing the vast Taklamakan Desert, merchants and missionaries carried Chinese silk to the west and Buddhist manuscripts, spices, and foreign merchandise back to China. Luxurious goods such as Persian silverware and textiles were in high demand by the Chinese nobility, and the result of the Tang quest for the exotic is visible in the ceramic vessels recovered from burial grounds., , One type of earthenware vessel, excavated mainly in Shaanxi and Henan provinces, is exemplified by this phoenix-headed ewer. Made with a mould, the ornaments on its sides include half-palmettes framing a mounted archer delivering his &quot;Parthian shot,&quot; a demonstration of excellent horsemanship in which the mounted archer turns to fire at a target directly behind him. The vessel's shape is based on an Iranian or Central Asian prototype, and the low-fire sancai (three-color) lead glaze, chiefly in brown, green, and blue with various gradations, is a typical design in Tang ceramics. The opulent colors of the sancai glaze, freely applied to the vessel, reflect the exuberant spirit of the great Tang empire., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tang/ho_1991.253.4.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tang/ho_1991.253.4.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2009, ElissaSCA: asian, ElissaSCA: chinese, ElissaSCA: ewer, ElissaSCA: vase, ElissaSCA: pottery, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 30","4308073159.jpg","-","Coins Games and Gladiators metropolitan_museum","Ahala","January 2010 a review of the display of coins within the Metropolitan Museum New York","Ahala: metropolitanmuseum,Ahala: greekromanart,Ahala: mmamembership,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 30","4308074049.jpg","-","Gods metropolitan_museum","Ahala","January 2010 a review of the display of coins within the Metropolitan Museum New York","Ahala: metropolitanmuseum,Ahala: greekromanart,Ahala: mmamembership,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 30","4327857345.jpg","1994.605.12","Chinese Bronze Mirror in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, April 2009","ElissaSCA","Mirror, Eastern Han dynasty (25-220), Bronze, , Accession #

(163.8 cm), Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, 1995 (1995.419), , Strategically located along the crossroads from the Mediterranean through ancient Bactria to northern India and China via Central Asia, Gandhara was of tremendous military and commercial significance. Throughout its early history it attracted many different figures and peoplesamong them, Alexander the Great, the Seleucids, Scythians, Bactrians, Sogdians, Indians, Romans, and Sassaniansall of whom in varying degrees left their cultural imprint on the region. Under the Kushans, a nomadic people of Scythian origin (or who merged with the Scythians), Gandhara achieved its greatest glory. The most important Kushan ruler, Kanishka, was one of Buddhism's greatest patrons, prompting Gandharan iconography to become almost completely Buddhist. The area's artistic style, however, reflects the classical legacy of Alexander's cultural heirs and is markedly dependent upon Hellenistic and Roman prototypes. This combination of strong classical influence with a virtually Buddhist iconographic program is the hallmark of Gandharan art. The most popular Gandharan image, after those representing the Buddha, was that of the bodhisattva, a being who attains enlightenment and escapes the cycle of death and rebirth but chooses to remain on earth to help others achieve salvation. The ideal of the bodhisattva is one of the basic tenets of Mahayana Buddhism. Heroic in scale and conception, this majestic torso is stunning in its visual impact. , , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=6&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=1995.419 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=6&amp;view...</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2007, ElissaSCA: asian, ElissaSCA: sculpture, ElissaSCA: statue, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: torso, ElissaSCA: fragment, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld, ElissaSCA: bodhisattva,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 30","2072078214.jpg","54.11.5","Terracotta Funerary Plaque done in Black Figure in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Funerary plaque, ca. 520510 B.C.; Archaic, black-figure, Greek, Attic, Terracotta; H. 10 1/4 in.

Typically, they were decorated with images that evoked myths and customs of ancient Greek funerary practices. A prothesis, or laying out of the dead, is depicted in the upper main register of this plaque. After having been bathed and clothed, the deceased has been laid out on a high bier with his feet set facing the door, as was customary in ancient Greece. The two cushions under his head would have prevented his jaws from sagging open. Mourners standing on either side of the bier gesture with their hands and pull at their hair. In the lower register, three quadrigas (four-horse chariots) race to the right. Each of the charioteers wears a belted white chiton., , The chariot race is a recurrent theme in Attic funerary art.

The animal's head, now partially broken away, is held upward and is twisted to the right, creating an impression of alertness. The artist has achieved a realistic rendering of an animal at rest, its weight thrown fully onto its left haunch, and its left hind leg tucked under its body. The bottom of the statue has been worn away, but it is likely that the hidden leg was originally indicated there. The entire body is contained within a single unbroken outline. The horns, ears, tail, and muscles were modeled in relief, although time and secondary use have flattened the contours on the right side. This combination of closed outline with broadly modeled masses and a minimum of incised detail is characteristic of animal sculpture from the Harappan-period levels at the site of Mohenjo Daro in the lower reaches of the Indus River. The function of these animal sculptures is unknown., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/ancient_near_eastern_art/reclining_mouflons_wild_sheep/objectview.aspx?collID=3&amp;OID=30005058 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/ancien...</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2009, ElissaSCA: asian, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld, ElissaSCA: indusvalley, ElissaSCA: sculpture, ElissaSCA: statue, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: sheep, ElissaSCA: animal,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 30","4343949699.jpg","1986.2","Head of a Bodhisattva in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2009","ElissaSCA","Head of a Bodhisattva, Afghanistan (possibly Hadda), 4th-5th century, Clay or terracotta, garnet, , Accession # 1986.2, , This bodhisattva head gives a sense of the high level of refinement that Afghan artists achieved in this medium.

Although unfinished, the piece is inscribed at the bottom: &quot;Anne Chase Made This Sampler In/ The Thirteenth Year of Her Age 1721.&quot; Actually, the fact that it Is unfinished adds to the sampler's interest, since it teaches us about how sampler patterns were laid out, and the process by which the girls of Newport worked their samplers. It is not known why Anne never finished itthe most likely reason is a young girl's frustration with the intricacies of such fine work.

Hermanos Gift, 1983 (1983.167), , The elegant articulation of the bust on this capital is evidence of the artistic revival in Constantinople after its restoration to Byzantine rule in 1261. The archangel Michael, who is identified by an inscription in Greek, wears a jeweled tunic and a diadem and holds both an orb and a staff. These elements of dress and attributes of authority reflect the long-established connection between archangels, who are the guardians of heaven, and the Byzantine emperor, Christ's representative on earth. This image may have been part of the decoration of the upper section of a tomb built into a niche. It is said to have been found near the ruins of the Monastery of the Virgin Peribleptos (All-Seeing), established in the early eleventh century by the Byzantine emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 102834), who was buried there. In the Late Byzantine period the site remained important, and the imperial court visited its church annually for the Feast of the Presentation of the Christ Child in the Temple, one of the Twelve Great Feasts (Dodekaorton) of the Orthodox Church., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arch/ho_1983.167.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arch/ho_1983.167.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2010, ElissaSCA: medieval, ElissaSCA: angel, ElissaSCA: capital, ElissaSCA: marble, ElissaSCA: christian, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: byzantine, ElissaSCA: bust, ElissaSCA: sculpture,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 30","4406893459.jpg","-","The Libyan Sybil","wamcclung","William Wetmore Story, 1861.
