(48.9 x 37.5 cm);Marquand Collection, Gift of Henry G. Marquand, 1890 (91.26.5);;This panel was painted by an artist in Leonardo da Vinci's circle and is deeply indebted to his example. But which of the leonardeschi it should be ascribed to has been a matter of some debate. It first appeared in the nineteenth century with an attribution to Leonardo himself but was later assigned to Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis, an artist trained in Milan and active as a portraitist at the Sforza and Habsburg courts. However, the portraits that are firmly attributed to Predis suggest that he remained tied to an older generation of painters and was scarcely influenced by Leonardo. Girl with Cherries, on the other hand, shows an artist grappling with Leonardo's ideas and technique; it belongs to a group of paintings of disputed authorship that share similar characteristics. It has been suggested that the creator of this fine group of works was the young Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, one of Leonardo's most talented followers, a keen observer and brilliant draftsman who genuinely understood his master's ideas. This is evident in the close attention paid to the girl's hand, with outstretched fingers; the slight turn of her head, with eyes glancing past the viewer; and the subtle fall of light over the flesh. The vibrant sense of life in her curls is a testament to Leonardo's love of the movement of hair, which he saw as similar to water currents and other paradigms of motion and which he studied in many drawings.;;In the nineteenth century, the subject of this painting was identified as Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit. However, it is more likely to represent an idealized portrait type. That the girl is crowned with ivy, which often encircles the heads of poets in drawings and paintings of this school, might suggest her connection with humanistic and literary circles in Milan.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lomb/hod_91.26.5.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lomb/hod_91.26.5.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: renaissance,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: portrait,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 34","2449781939.jpg","1975.1.201","Two Young Girls at the Piano by Renoir in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2008","ElissaSCA","Two Young Girls at the Piano, 1892;Pierre-Auguste Renoir (Limoges 1841 Cagnes-sur-Mer 1919);French;Oil on canvas; 44 x 34 in.

Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expressionall of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a).;;Reconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. ;;The overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor.

Its scenes, from the book known as Amduat, describe the voyage of the sun god through the twelve hours of the night. The middle register shows the god in a shrine on his night boat. Above and below are various beings who dwell in the netherworld.

To either side are four pairs of male (frog-headed) and female (snake-headed) deities representing the four qualities of the primeval waters : inert, negative, infinite and inaccessible. The sides are inscribed with the Litany of Re, addressed to the seventy-four forms of the sun god. The left side shows Wereshnefer, at the head end, worshiping the first thirty-seven of these forms plus the ancestral kings of Upper Egypt. On the right side, Wereshnefer faces the last thirty-seven forms plus the ancestral kings of Lower Egypt. The top of the lid has two scenes. The foot and the center depict the sun's rays resurrecting the mummy of Osiris, lying in its shrine in the depths of the neterworld, just as Wereshnefer hoped they would revive his body.

It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.;;In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.

Often the Virgin is simply shown in sorrowful contemplation so as to emphasize a maternal sensibility not described in the Gospels but rather derived from mystical writings disseminated among converts.;;In this composition, Mary's sorrowful gesture relates the theme to the more elaborate portrayal of the Lamentation at the foot of the cross. So, too, does the corpselike rigidity of Christ's torso, a pose typical of the late fifteenth century. The use of alabaster was particularly characteristic of architectural and figural sculpture in Catalonia and Aragon, but this group has not yet been conclusively linked to the work of any artist of that region.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: virgin,ElissaSCA: pieta,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: spanish,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","2916471845.jpg","-","Sculpture at the MET","photographics@snet.net","Ugolino and His Sons, modeled ca. 186061, executed in marble 186567;Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (French, 18271875)","photographics@snet.net: sculpture,photographics@snet.net: metropolitanmuseumofart,photographics@snet.net: nikon,photographics@snet.net: d300,photographics@snet.net: nude,photographics@snet.net: marble,photographics@snet.net: macro,photographics@snet.net: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3030523836.jpg","-","European Sculpture Court, the Met","emily","NA","emily: metropolitanmuseumofart,emily: manhattan,emily: newyorkcity,emily: newyork,emily: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3105312030.jpg","09.181.7","Young Woman with a Gilded Wreath in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2008","ElissaSCA","Young Woman with a Gilded Wreath;120-140 AD;Encaustic on wood;;Accession # 09.181.7;;This panel was not painted in the areas where the mummy wrappings would have covered the edges.

It is a powerful instance of the vitality of contemporary expression in Africa and the continuity that exists with the traditional forms that are the focus of the Museum's collection. The recent series of works that Between Earth and Heaven relates to refer to the celebrated West African traditions of strip-woven textiles, namely that of kente developed by Akan and Ewe weavers in Anatsui's native Ghana. Those traditional textiles are at once monumental in scale and highly sculptural in the way they drape the body as the apparel of leaders. The undulation of this work evokes that tactile quality, and its resplendent color scheme of gold, red, and black translates and transposes the aesthetic of finely woven silk into the medium of base metal.","Rebecca Schear: elanatsui,Rebecca Schear: aluminum,Rebecca Schear: copperwire,Rebecca Schear: metal,Rebecca Schear: ghana,Rebecca Schear: textile,Rebecca Schear: stripwoven,Rebecca Schear: kente,Rebecca Schear: sculpture,Rebecca Schear: gold,Rebecca Schear: metropolitanmuseumofart,Rebecca Schear: africanart,Rebecca Schear: newyorkcity,Rebecca Schear: canon,Rebecca Schear: eos,Rebecca Schear: themet,Rebecca Schear: museum,Rebecca Schear: nyc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3637411668.jpg","-","Pillar of Dendur","kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!","NA","kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: newyorkcity,kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: templeofdendur,kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: pillar,kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: egypt,kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: egyptian,kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: metropolitanmuseum,kimbar/Thanks for 1.5 million views!: egyptianart,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3683157486.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Rebecca Schear","NA","Rebecca Schear: metropolitanmuseum,Rebecca Schear: newyorkcity,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3683159186.jpg","-","Lamassu","Rebecca Schear","Human-headed winged lion (lamassu), 883859 B.C.; Neo-Assyrian period, reign of Ashurnasirpal II;Excavated at Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), northern Mesopotamia;Alabaster (gypsum);H. 10 ft. 3 1/2 in. (313.7 cm);Gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr., 1932 (32.143.2);;From the ninth to the seventh century B.C., the kings of Assyria ruled over a vast empire centered in northern Iraq. The first great Assyrian king was Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883859 B.C.), who undertook a vast building program at Nimrud, ancient Kalhu. Until it became the capital city under Ashurnasirpal, Nimrud had been no more than a provincial town.;The new capital occupied an area of about 900 acres, around which Ashurnasirpal constructed a mud-brick wall 120 feet thick, 42 feet high, and 5 miles long. In the southwest corner of this enclosure was the acropolis, where the temples, palaces, and administrative offices of the empire were located. In 879 B.C. Ashurnasirpal held a festival for 69,574 people to celebrate the construction of the new capital, and the event was documented by an inscription that read: &quot;the happy people of all the lands together with the people of Kalhufor ten days I feasted, wined, bathed, and honored them and sent them back to their home in peace and joy.&quot;;Ashurnasirpal's palace is described in the so-called Standard Inscription that ran across the surface of most of the reliefs: &quot;I built thereon [a palace with] halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, teak, terebinth, and tamarisk[?] as my royal dwelling and for the enduring leisure life of my lordship.&quot; The inscription continues: &quot;Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made it [the palace] fittingly imposing.&quot; Such limestone beasts are the human-headed, winged bull and lion pictured here. The horned cap attests to their divinity, and the belt signifies their power. The sculptor gave these guardian figures five legs so that they appear to be standing firmly when viewed from the front but striding forward when seen from the side. These lamassi protected and supported important doorways in Assyrian palaces.","Rebecca Schear: lamassu,Rebecca Schear: humanhead,Rebecca Schear: wingedlion,Rebecca Schear: assyrian,Rebecca Schear: ashurnasirpal,Rebecca Schear: nimrud,Rebecca Schear: ancient,Rebecca Schear: kalhu,Rebecca Schear: alabaster,Rebecca Schear: gypsum,Rebecca Schear: mesopotamia,Rebecca Schear: metropolitanmuseum,Rebecca Schear: newyorkcity,Rebecca Schear: palace,Rebecca Schear: nyc,Rebecca Schear: themet,Rebecca Schear: museum,Rebecca Schear: rockefeller,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3708689594.jpg","-","fox","Zhura","Style of Shibata Zeshin;Metropolitan NY","Zhura: metropolitan,Zhura: ny,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3708707974.jpg","-","The Adoration of the Magi 17","Zhura","Hieronymus Bosch ;Netherlandish, active by 1480, died 1516;oil and gold on wood;1470-75;Metropolitan NY","Zhura: metropolitan,Zhura: ny,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 34","3719119804.jpg","-","Lip Service","amy allcock","Yellow jasper fragment of Queen Tiye of Egypt from the Egyptian Art Collection at the <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/ rel=nofollow>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> (aka &quot;The Met&quot;) in New York City.

Michael Paul Foundation Inc. Gift and Charles Ulrick and Josephine Bay Foundation Inc. Gift, and Fletcher Fund, 1967 (67.250);;Dante's Divine Comedy has always enjoyed favor in the plastic arts. Ugolino, the character that galvanized peoples' fantasies and fears during the second half of the nineteenth century, appears in Canto 33 of the Inferno. This intensely Romantic sculpture derives from the passage in which Dante describes the imprisonment in 1288 and subsequent death by starvation of the Pisan count Ugolino della Gherardesca and his offspring. Carpeaux depicts the moment when Ugolino, condemned to die of starvation, yields to the temptation to devour his children and grandchildren, who cry out to him:;;But when to our somber cell was thrown;A slender ray, and each face was lit;I saw in each the aspect of my own,;For very grief both of my hands I bit,;And suddenly from the floor arising they,;Thinking my hunger was the cause of it,;Exclaimed: Father eat thou of us, and stay;Our suffering: thou didst our being dress;In this sad flesh; now strip it all away.;;Carpeaux's visionary composition reflects his reverence for Michelangelo, as well as his own painstaking concern with anatomical realism. Ugolino and His Sons was completed in plaster in 1861, the last year of his residence at the French Academy in Rome. A sensation in Rome, it brought Carpeaux many commissions. Upon his return to France, Ugolino was cast in bronze at the order of the French Ministry of Fine Arts and exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1863. Later it was moved to the gardens of the Tuilieries, where it was displayed as a pendant to a bronze of the Laocoon. This marble version was executed by the practitioner Bernard under Carpeaux's supervision and completed in time for the Universal Exposition at Paris in 1867.
