(175.3 x 193 cm);Rogers Fund, 1903 (03.14.6);;This fresco panel from Boscoreale depicts a man and woman seated side by side. To the right is the heroic figure of a semi-nude man lounging on an elaborate, gilded chair. A dark-colored himation is loosely draped across his loins. Unfortunately, damage to the fresco has obliterated the upper part of the man's head, which was turned in profile toward the woman seated to his right. He rests his hands on a short gilded staff firmly set on the ground in front of him. Most likely this is a scepter, an ancient symbol of regal power that was also an attribute of Zeus, ruler of the Olympian gods. For Hellenistic dynasts, the scepter retained a strong meaning of justice. The late third-century B.C. philosopher Theophrastus advised that 'the true king should rule by the scepter and not the spear&quot; (Peri basileias II).;;To the left is a seated woman wearing a chiton and a himation that is drawn up over the back of her head. She rests her feet on a gilded footstool, and leans her chin on her hand in a gesture of reflection. Based on stylistic comparisons with other works of art, it has been suggested that the seated figures represent Achilles and his mother Thetis. For the spectator in antiquity, the woman's melancholy countenance and the gesture with her right hand may have been read as expressions of Thetis' concern or grief at the fate of her only son. More recently, however, it has been suggested that the woman represents the wife of the seated Hellenistic ruler to her left. As Roman aristocrats greatly admired Alexander the Great and the first generation of his successors, this seated ruler may be a dynast of the early Hellenistic period. The inclusion of this panel and the others that once adorned Room H of the villa at Boscoreale would have created a majestic interior that had particular relevance to political life in Rome during the time the villa was decorated, sometime between 60 and 30 B.C.

Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Seated woman playing a kithara: From Room H of the Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale, ca. 4030 B.C.; Late Republican;Roman;Wall painting; Fresco: 72 1/2 x 72 1/2 in. (186 x 186 cm);Rogers Fund, 1903 (03.14.5);;This painting of a seated woman playing a kithara is from Room H, either a dining room (triclinium) or a room for social gatherings (oecus), in the villa at Boscoreale. Each of the paintings that originally adorned this room derives from the Greek tradition of megalographia, or large-scale painting, about which so much was written in antiquity; Apollinaris of Sidonius, Petronius in the Satyricon, and Vitruvius all shed light on the use of megalographia in Roman villas.;;In this fresco, the kithara player is depicted as a plump young woman clothed in a purple chiton and white himation. She is adorned with a bracelet, earrings, and headband with a central medallion, all of gold. A small figure of Atlas supports the arm of her elaborately carved chair that originally was lacquered a deep lustrous red. The instrument she plays is not a simple lyre, but a gilded kithara, a large concert instrument played by Apollo and professional musicians. Behind the seated woman stands a small girl wearing a sleeveless purple chiton. She, too, is adorned with a gold headband, bracelet, and loop earrings. Like portrait figures, the woman and the girl gaze directly at the spectator.;;Most recently it has been suggested that the pair may represent a Macedonian queen, or princess, and her daughter or younger sister. The gilded kithara and richly adorned, thronelike chair, as well as the carefully rendered gold jewelry and headbands, give the impression of royal personage. Whatever the exact subject, this painting and others in the villa were admired as excellent copies of Hellenistic art that emphasized the erudition and worldliness of the villa's owner.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cubi/hod_03.14.5.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cubi/hod_03.14.5.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: boscoreale,ElissaSCA: villa,ElissaSCA: musician,ElissaSCA: chair,ElissaSCA: red,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: fresco,2D,Art2or3,fresco_mosaic,Artwork","Fresco_Mosaic""SET 21","4129280874.jpg","-","Portrait of a Young Man in Three-Quarter View Looking over His Left Shoulder  Anonymous, Italian, Roman-Bolognese, 17th century  1600-1700, MET, NYC","renzodionigi","NA","renzodionigi: portrait,renzodionigi: ritratto,renzodionigi: arte,renzodionigi: italiana,renzodionigi: italian,renzodionigi: art,renzodionigi: fine,renzodionigi: painting,renzodionigi: sculpture,renzodionigi: design,2D,Art2or3,drawing,Artwork","Drawing""SET 21","4129281244.jpg","-","Portrait  Anonymous, Italian, Roman-Bolognese, 17th century  1600-1700.

(47.2 x 31.9 cm);Gift of Arthur A. Houghton Jr., 1970 (1970.301.3);;The fight against the obscure forces of evil, here personified by a horde of multicolored divs (demons), was among the most challenging tasks of the early kings of Iran. Tahmuras, who became known as the &quot;div-binder,&quot; was the ruler who succeeded in subduing them. In order to have their lives spared, the divs promised to teach man the precious art of writing. This is how humankind learned various alphabets, including Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Persian, and Sogdian.;;This extraordinary painting, which has been attributed to Sultan Muhammad, reveals the penchant for experimentation that characterizes the work of Persian artists in this period. In addition to some foreshortenings and the depiction of figures in perspective, which probably imitate Western examples, the imagery of divs in this manuscript witnesses remarkable changes when compared to past illustrations. They become progressively anthropomorphizedby means of explicit sexualizationand incorporate traits of demons of Central Asian origin, which, we know, were circulating on both silk and paper in the royal library at Tabriz.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1970.301.3 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1970.301.3</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: islamic,ElissaSCA: manuscript,ElissaSCA: illumination,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: inscription,2D,Art2or3,Artwork","Book_Manuscript""SET 21","5367259354.jpg","-","So...","This is how it goes...","Met Museum;NYC;Like a long time ago...","This is how it goes...: nyc,This is how it goes...: metmuseum,This is how it goes...: kennedyandi,This is how it goes...: selfportraitish,2D,Art2or3,photography,Artwork","Photography""SET 21","5350049011.jpg","-","Petite danseuse agee de quatorze ans - Edgar Degas","Jerome Mercier","Metropolitan Museum of Art - New York","Jerome Mercier: usa,Jerome Mercier: newyork,Jerome Mercier: met,Jerome Mercier: metropolitanmuseumofart,Jerome Mercier: petitedanseuseageedequatorzeans,Jerome Mercier: edgardegas,Jerome Mercier: metropolitanmuseum,Jerome Mercier: wwwmetmuseumorg,Description,2D,Art2or3,3D,Artwork,painting_and_sculpture","Sculpture""SET 21","3818519566.jpg","-","Roses  Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 18531890)  1890.

MET, NYC","renzodionigi","Pompeo Girolamo Batoni (25 January 1708 4 February 1787) was an Italian painter whose style incorporated elements of the French Rococo, Bolognese classicism, and nascent Neoclassicism.;He was born in Lucca, the son of a goldsmith, Paolino Batoni. He moved to Rome in 1727, and apprenticed with Agostino Masucci, Sebastiano Conca and/or Francesco Imperiale (1679-1740).;By the early 1740s, however, he started to receive independent commissions. In 1741, he was inducted into the Accademia di San Luca. His celebrated painting, The Ecstasy of Saint Catherine of Siena (1743) illustrates his academic refinement of the late-Baroque style. Another masterpiece, his Fall of Simon Magus was painted initially for the St Peter's Basilica.;Batoni became a highly-fashionable painter in Rome, particularly after his rival, the proto-neoclassicist Anton Raphael Mengs, departed for Spain in 1761. Batoni befriended Winckelmann and, like him, aimed in his painting to the restrained classicism of painters from earlier centuries, such as Raphael and Poussin, rather than to the work of the Venetian artists then in vogue.;He was greatly in demand for portraits, particularly by the British traveling through Rome, who took pleasure in commissioning standing portraits set in the milieu of antiquities, ruins, and works of art. There are records of over 200 portraits by Batoni of visiting British patrons. Such &quot;Grand Tour&quot; portraits by Batoni came to proliferate in the British private collections, thus ensuring the genre's popularity in the United Kingdom, where Sir Joshua Reynolds would become its leading practitioner. In 1760, the painter Benjamin West, while visiting Rome would complain that Italian artists &quot;talked of nothing, looked at nothing but the works of Pompeo Batoni&quot;.;In 1769, the double portrait of Joseph II and Leopold II won an Austrian nobility for Batoni. He also portrayed Pope Pius VI. According to a rumor, he bequeathed his palette and brushes to Jacques-Louis David.;He was married twice, to Caterina Setti (d. 1742) in 1729, and then to Lucia Fattori in 1747, and had twelve children; three of his sons assisted in his studio. From 1759 Batoni lived in a large house on the Via Bocca di Leone in Rome, which included a studio as well as exhibition rooms and a drawing academy. He died in Rome.;","renzodionigi: portrait,renzodionigi: ritratto,renzodionigi: arte,renzodionigi: italiana,renzodionigi: italian,renzodionigi: art,renzodionigi: fine,renzodionigi: painting,renzodionigi: sculpture,renzodionigi: design,2D,Art2or3,Artwork,painting","Painting""SET 21","4161998507.jpg","-","Self-portrait  Gerrit Dou (Dutch, 16131675)  ca. 1665 .

Presiding over the scene of Creation is God the Father, bathed in a glowing celestial light as he is borne aloft by seraphim. Beside the &quot;mappamondo&quot; (map of the world) is the garden of Paradise, its four rivers issuing from the ground at the lower right. The garden's effulgent flora symbolize the pure and sinless state of man before the Fall. A diminutive Adam and Eve are expelled from the garden by a lithe angel whose unusual nakedness and human form may symbolize his deep compassion for the corrupted state of humankind after the fall from grace.;;;This panel was originally at the far left of the predella from Giovanni di Paolo's &quot;Guelfi Altarpiece&quot; formerly in the Church of San Domenico in Siena (now Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence).

(47.2 x 31.9 cm);Gift of Arthur A. Houghton Jr., 1970 (1970.301.3);;The fight against the obscure forces of evil, here personified by a horde of multicolored divs (demons), was among the most challenging tasks of the early kings of Iran. Tahmuras, who became known as the &quot;div-binder,&quot; was the ruler who succeeded in subduing them. In order to have their lives spared, the divs promised to teach man the precious art of writing. This is how humankind learned various alphabets, including Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Persian, and Sogdian.;;This extraordinary painting, which has been attributed to Sultan Muhammad, reveals the penchant for experimentation that characterizes the work of Persian artists in this period. In addition to some foreshortenings and the depiction of figures in perspective, which probably imitate Western examples, the imagery of divs in this manuscript witnesses remarkable changes when compared to past illustrations. They become progressively anthropomorphizedby means of explicit sexualizationand incorporate traits of demons of Central Asian origin, which, we know, were circulating on both silk and paper in the royal library at Tabriz.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1970.301.3 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1970.301.3</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: islamic,ElissaSCA: manuscript,ElissaSCA: illumination,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,2D,Art2or3,Artwork,painting","Painting""SET 21","5350827055.jpg","1997.371","Study for a Portrait of an Indian by Girodet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2010","ElissaSCA","Study for Portrait of an Indian;Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson (French, 17671824);Oil on canvas ;16 x 12 7/8 in.

Returning to Paris after his stay at the French Academy in Rome, Girodet developed a style marked by literary preciosity, imaginary pictorial effects, and exotic subjects and settings. This is the oil sketch for a lifesize portrait now at the Musee Girodet at Montargis. When the lifesize canvas was sold at the posthumous auction of Girodet's studio, it was catalogued as a portrait of an Indian and dated 1807.

At the left, Persephone steps up from Hades through a cleft in the ground, as Hermes, messenger of the gods, stands back. The goddess Hekate, &quot;daughter of dark-bosomed night&quot; according to Bacchylides, a Greek poet of the fifth century B.C., occupies the center of the vase holding two flaming torches with which she illuminates Persephone's nighttime journey from the Underworld. Lastly, at the far right stands Demeter. The importance of the nocturnal setting of the scene is underscored by the prominent size of the torches held by Hekate, and emphasized by her central position within the composition.;;The scene illustrates one episode from the myth of Persephone's abduction by Hades recounted in the sixth-century B.C. Homeric Hymn to Demeter. From the hymn we learn that Persephone is to spend one-third of the year with her husband in the realm of the dead, and two-thirds of it on earth with Demeter, the goddess who gave the gift of grain to mankind, and who is responsible for the growth of crops. This krater shows Persephone in the midst of her ascent, her return, heralding the arrival of spring and the beginning of growing season. Despite the positive allegorical significance of Persephone's return for ancient Greeks, it was not a well-developed theme in ancient literature. The vivid pictorial conception of this episode, including the deliberate reference to time on this bell-krater, it seems is a strictly visual convention. The root of this iconographical tradition may lie in the fact that the arrival of spring was viewed as an annual, ritual event, and such events were celebrated at night. A clearly defined time therefore was an essential element of the pictorial typology of Persephone's return. Such a detail would have reflected actual cult practice, which would have added a level of tangible realism to the scene for the ancient viewer.;;Persephone is seen emerging out of the earth wearing a himation over her pleated linen chiton. Demeter also wears a chiton of crinkled fabric beneath a long himation. With his traveling staff in hand, Hermes dons his characteristic broad-rimmed traveling hat (petasos) and short cloak (chlamys). Hekate, dressed in an open-sided peplos, guides the way with lighted torches.;;Women and men in ancient Greece wore the chiton, peplos, and himation in various configurations.

A palace of boxwood, mulberry, cedar, cypress, pistachio, tamarisk, and poplar...for my royal dwelling and for my lordly pleasure I founded therein, I adorned and made glorious.&quot;In these words, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II, who ruled from 883 through 859 B.C., describes the founding of his new capital city, Kalhu (modern Nimrud), and the construction of his palace. The mounds of Nimrud rise abruptly from the plain on the east bank of the Tigris River about twenty miles south of the modern town of Mosul in northern Iraq. On the raised terrace of the citadel, the Northwest Palace, begun by Ashurnasirpal and completed by his successors, covers an immense area more than 650 feet long and 390 feet wide. The citadel was contained within the massive city wall, which had a circuit of five miles and enclosed approximately nine hundred acres. ;Ashurnasirpal II built his palace in the northwest section of the citadel of Nimrud. The palace was organized around three large courtyards. State apartments and the major throne room were situated around the first courtyard. The second was surrounded by rooms devoted to the internal business of the palace, while the living quarters were in the innermost courtyard. Beneath its rooms was a tomb belonging to three Assyrian queens. ;The state apartments were decorated in a fashion not found in earlier Mesopotamian royal buildings. Huge stone slabs, carved with scenes of figures in relief and inscribed with a record of important events in the king's reign, lined the sun-dried mud-brick walls. Wooden furniture adorned with carved ivory panels was used throughout the palace. ;","NA,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 21","4730374606.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

Seated on a throne, the king is accompanied by a smaller male figure personifying the local god of the Coptite nome, the fifth nome (province) of Upper Egypt. This deity offers the king an ankh (hieroglyph meaning &quot;life&quot;) with his left hand. The nome standard, with its double-falcon emblem, is carved above the god's head. Sahure wears the nemes headcloth and straight false beard of a living pharaoh. The flaring hood of the uraeus, the cobra goddess who protected Egyptian kings, is visible on his brow. The nome god wears the archaic wig and curling beard of a deity.;;The statue may have been intended to decorate the king's pyramid complex at Abusir, about fifteen miles south of Giza. At the end of the previous dynasty, multiple statues of this type were placed in the temple of Menkaure (Mycerinus) to symbolize the gathering of nome gods from Upper and Lower Egypt around the king. However, since no other statues of this type are preserved from Sahure's reign, it is possible that this statue was a royal dedication in one of the temples in Coptos (modern Qift).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/oking/ho_18.2.4.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/oking/ho_18.2.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 21","5000551986.jpg","48.160.1","Wall Decoration from the Funerary Apartments of King Djoser in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2008","ElissaSCA","Wall Decoration from the Funerary Apartments of King Djoser ;Dynasty 3, reign of Djoser (ca. 2630-2611 BC);Blue-green faience; ledges are modern plaster restoration;;Accession # 48.160.1;;Tiles mounted between sculpted limestone ledges decorated the walls of the galleries underneath Djoser's Step Pyramid and underneath a building in his complex called the Southern Tomb.

Small figurines show warriors wearing similar clasps, suggesting this was designed for use by a soldier. It is typical of a type of buckle produced in the central plain region of the Iberian Peninsula, where silver is found in the Sierra Morena mountains. In design it is closely related to engraved examples of artwork in Andalusia in the southwest of Spain, a province that strongly influenced the artistic development of the rest of Iberia. Opposing spirals were a popular motif in Celtic art and were often combined with concentric circles on buckles such as this one. The design was created by carving out a pattern on a bronze panel, and then hammering a thin sheet of silver into the indentations.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1990.62ab rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1990.62ab</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: celtic,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: metalwork,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: silver,ElissaSCA: spanish,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 21","5335970378.jpg","-","Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

Crawford may have wished to demonstrate in visual form Prescotts central thesis that the Spaniards conquered Mexico in order to convert native peoples to Christianity.
