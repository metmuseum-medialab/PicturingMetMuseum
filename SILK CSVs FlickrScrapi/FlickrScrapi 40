He had first explored this theme in &quot;Surprise&quot; of 1891 (private collection), two years before he retired from his post as a customs official (hence his nickname, &quot;le Douanier&quot;) to devote himself full-time to his art. Rousseau's early biographers, wishing to explain the gap between his fantastic jungle scenes and his pedestrian life as a civil servant, traced the self-taught artist's inspiration to his supposed adventures as a young soldier in Mexico and South America. However, the tales they had spun began to unravel, and Rousseau was forced to admit that he had &quot;never traveled further than to the hothouses in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.&quot; Besides frequenting the city's botanical gardens and menageries, Rousseau drew inspiration from popular ethnographic journals and illustrated children's books.","Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: repast,Maulleigh: lion,Maulleigh: henri,Maulleigh: rousseau,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: new,Maulleigh: york,Maulleigh: city,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","2750367889.jpg","51.112.2","Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary),","Maulleigh","Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary), 1891;Paul Gauguin (French, 18481903);Oil on canvas; 44 3/4 x 34 1/2 in.

The legend was widely associated with the origin of the cult of the Rosary, a popular form of personal devotion during the age of the Reformation. The picture includes a topographical view of the park and Coudenberg Palace of the dukes of Brabant in Brussels and must have been commissioned for a member of the Habsburg court, possibly the lords of Ravensteyn.

The scene at the base seems related to a well-known legend of a miracle that saved a man from his captors: the Christ Child, held by the Virgin, unfurls a rosary of white and red roses made from blossoms that issue from the man's mouth each time he recites a Hail Mary. The legend was widely associated with the origin of the cult of the Rosary, a popular form of personal devotion during the age of the Reformation. The picture includes a topographical view of the park and Coudenberg Palace of the dukes of Brabant in Brussels and must have been commissioned for a member of the Habsburg court, possibly the lords of Ravensteyn. Based on the style and distinctive features in parts of the painting, it has been attributed to Goswijn van der Weyden, grandson of the great Rogier van der Weyden.","Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: fifteen,Maulleigh: mysteries,Maulleigh: virgin,Maulleigh: rosary,Maulleigh: detail,Maulleigh: painting,Maulleigh: coudenberg,Maulleigh: palace,Maulleigh: habsburg,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3205943349.jpg","-","In the Gallery, 2009","Maulleigh","This is the woman I wanted to be when I was 12.

Typical of Goya's work at this time, they are more remarkable for their differences than their similarities: he is official, she is informal; he is standing, she is sitting. At mid-career, Goya made fewer concessions to formal conventions, attractiveness, and rank. Colonel Garcini, an official in the War Department, wears the uniform of the Corps of Engineers. The embroidered red cross on his coat and the badge of the Order of Santiago are decorations he received in 1806 and must have been added to the portrait later.

It is thought that the man shown from the back in the lower left corner was originally meant to depict an artist, perhaps Cezanne himself. The imagery, a composite of scenes of leisure, derives from paintings by Manet and Monet from the 1860s. Underlying the Impressionist motifs are prototypes found in the work of Giorgione, Titian, and Veronese. Cezanne often included references to Venetian painting when he was working in his pastoral modea strain in his art that culminated in the late pictures of bathers.","Maulleigh: paul,Maulleigh: cezanne,Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: fishermen,Maulleigh: artgalleryandmuseums,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3227001780.jpg","32.100.43","Francesco d'Este (born about 1430, died after 1475), ca. 1460","Maulleigh","Francesco d'Este (born about 1430, died after 1475), ca. 1460;Rogier van der Weyden (Netherlandish, 1399/14001464);Oil on wood; Overall 12 1/2 x 8 3/4 in.

In 1444, Francesco was sent to the Netherlands, where he received his education and military training at the court of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. He was educated with Philip's son, Charles de Charlerois (later Charles the Bold), and became a permanent chamberlain to the duke, acting frequently as an envoy to Italy. This portrait was painted in the Netherlands about 1460, when Francesco was around thirty years old. The hammer and ring he holds may be prizes won for a jousting victory, or symbols of his office and power. On the verso of the panel are painted the splendid coat of arms and crest of the Este family, quartered with the honor bestowed on the house of Este in 1432 by Charles VII of France. Above and below the armorials is the inscription, which reads, in part: &quot;entirely yours, marquis of Este, Francesco.&quot; This apparent dedication suggests that the portrait was not kept by the sitter but was presented by him to a close acquaintance or member of the court as a gift of friendship. The portrait was painted by Rogier van der Weyden, who undertook a number of portrait commissions for members of the Burgundian court, while the verso was probably painted by a workshop assistant.","Maulleigh: rogier,Maulleigh: van,Maulleigh: der,Maulleigh: weyden,Maulleigh: francesco,Maulleigh: deste,Maulleigh: artgalleryandmuseums,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3240609854.jpg","04.29.2","The Titan's Goblet, 1833","Maulleigh","The Titan's Goblet, 1833;Thomas Cole (American, 18011848);Oil on canvas; 19 3/8 x 16 1/8 in.

Avery Jr., 1904 (04.29.2);;A striking example of Cole's romantic fantasies, this painting echoes the artist's other works of the period in its Italianate scenery and its attempt to illustrate themes dealing with the grandeur of antiquity, the passage of time, and the reassertion of nature. Rejected by Cole's patron, Luman Reed, and subsequently owned by the artist John M. Falconer, The Titan's Goblet defies full explanation. The massive goblet, trimmed with vegetation, around whose rim are found classical ruins, and on whose glassy surface boats sail, has been linked to both Norse legend and Greek mythology. Theophilus Stringfellow, Jr., described it as a self-contained, microcosmic human world in the midst of vast nature; Falconer linked the monumental stem of the goblet to the trunk of the Norse world-tree, likening it to &quot;the ramifying branches ... which spread out and hold between them an ocean dotted with sails, surrounded by dense forests and plains.&quot; Other theories tie the fantastic forms to J. M. W. Turner's Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus (National Gallery, London), to Italian architecture and geological formations, or to the golden goblet of the sun god Helios. The loftiness of the cup, rimmed with classical remnants, suggests the temporary gulf between the present, embodied in the surrounding landscape, from the classical culture that continues to nourish with its cascading waters.;;<i>Oddly fantastical for him.</i>","Maulleigh: thomas,Maulleigh: cole,Maulleigh: titan,Maulleigh: goblet,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3242097621.jpg","19.112","Edward R.

Like Titian as well is the broadly painted, shimmering silk of the man's clothing. Moretto was also inspired by the remarkable portraits of the Venetian artist Lorenzo Lotto, whose sitters often have a rather inward-looking expression, as does this one, and who hold or are surrounded by objects that have special meaning to them. Here, an hourglass sits on a carpet-covered ledge, and the man grasps a scrolled sheet of paper, the blank side of which faces the viewer. The hourglass no doubt alludes to the passing of time, an allegorical device often employed in sixteenth-century portraiture, but its precise meaning remains elusive.","Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3261399515.jpg","52.184","The Palace and Gardens of Versailles, 181819 (Detail)","Maulleigh","John Vanderlyn (17751852);;The Palace and Gardens of Versailles, 181819;;Oil on canvas; 12 x 165 ft.

The subject of the painting has been a matter of some debate, and its current title derives from the three pairs of figurestwo children, two young adults, and two older menwhich may be symbolic of the three stages of life. This interpretation is questionable on two counts. First, that the boys seem to be spying on the amorous couple (who also must contend with the goats pressing in against them) implies a narrative unified in time, rather than completely separate vignettes. Then, technical evidence shows that the old men were painted over the already completed vegetation and thus may have been afterthoughts.;;The historian Paolo Giovio, a contemporary of the artist, made a distinction between Dosso's &quot;proper works&quot; (justis operibus)that is, those with serious subjectsand his landscapes, which he called parerga, embellishments meant to delight and refresh, without any deeper purpose. As Giovio knew, such an approach had a direct precedent in the work of the ancient Roman artist Studius, as described by Pliny, which added to its cachet.

He retained the modello for himself and prominently showed it in a painting he made of his studio in 174749 (Akademie der Bildenden Kunste, Vienna). The rare subject concerns Saint Basil the Great (ca. 330379), archbishop of Caesarea, and his resistance to the Arian emperor Valens. The emperor, having failed to banish the refractory bishop, came with his retinue to hear Basil celebrate mass on the Feast of the Epiphany. According to the funeral oration of Basil's friend Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, Valens was &quot;struck . . . by the angelic rather than human order which pervaded the sanctuary. . . . Overcome by human weakness, his eyes were affected with dimness and giddiness.&quot; In Subleyras's painting, Basil stands surrounded by priests in a church interior lit by a shaft of light, as Valens swoons at the right.;;Because he spent virtually the whole of his career in Rome, Subleyras is not as well known today as many of his French contemporaries. An artist of high seriousness and exquisite sensibility, he is the middle term between Poussin and David.","Maulleigh: pierre,Maulleigh: hubert,Maulleigh: subleyras,Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: mass,Maulleigh: saint,Maulleigh: basil,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3277154019.jpg","-","At the MET","Maulleigh","NA","Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3277671674.jpg","-","The Four Seasons","Maulleigh","Giuseppe Arcimboldo;Italian, Milanese, 1526-1593;;<i>Giuseppe Arcimboldo (also spelled Arcimboldi; 1527 - July 11, 1593) was an Italian painter best known for creating imaginative portrait heads made entirely of such objects as fruits, vegetables, flowers, fish, and books that is, he painted representations of these objects on the canvas arranged in such a way that the whole collection of objects formed a recognizable likeness of the portrait subject.</i>","Maulleigh: giuseppe,Maulleigh: arcimboldo,Maulleigh: arcimboldi,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 40","3278030646.jpg","-","Portrait of a Man, possibly Nicolaes Pietersz Duyst van Voorhout (born about 1600, died 1650)","Maulleigh","Frans Hals (Dutch, 1582/831666);;Title;Portrait of a Man, possibly Nicolaes Pietersz Duyst van Voorhout (born about 1600, died 1650);;Date;ca. 163638;;Medium;Oil on canvas;;Dimensions;31 3/4 x 26 in.

His patrons included the Holy Roman Emperor, the dukes of Saxony, and the king of Poland. The man's armor displayed here bears the mark of Nuremberg; Lochner's personal mark, a rampant lion; and the date 1548. The armor was originally part of a small garniture that included exchange elements for field and tournament use. Restorations include the cuirass and the gauntlets.;The horse armor bears only the Nuremberg mark but can be attributed to Lochner on stylistic grounds. The elaborately embossed and etched decoration of the peytral (chest defense) includes an abbreviated inscription that may be interpreted: 1548 K[rist] I[ch] T[rau] G[anz] V[nd] G[ar] H[ans] E[rnst] H[erzog] Z[u] Sachsen (1548 In Christ I trust wholly Hans [Johann] Ernst, Duke of Saxony). Duke Johann Ernst (15211553) may have commissioned the horse armor for his attendance at the Diet of Augsburg, a political assembly of the German nobility called in 1548 by Charles V to deal with the crisis of the Reformation.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, enjoy a <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metal,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: sculpture,qpkarl: statue,qpkarl: steel,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 40","371956558.jpg","-","Armadura II","gdiazdeleon","Horse armour.

Deely, in memory of Patricia Johnson Deely, 1997 (1997.491);;Carpeaux and his atelier worked up a successful commercial edition of terracotta busts based on the bronze figures constituting his Four Parts of the World Sustaining the Globe, which is the central element of the fountain of the Observatory in the Luxembourg Gardens, Paris. The date of 1872 on this sensitively detailed example corresponds to that of the plaster model of the group shown in that year's Salon; the fountain itself was inaugurated in 1874. Carpeaux was a liberal romantic whose humanitarian sentiments are manifest in the Metropolitan Museum's bust derived from the fountain's figure of Africa. He added a Michelangelesque sideward turn, ropes across the chest that seem barely able to contain the young woman's energy, and the poignant inscription on the base: Pourquoi! Naitre esclave! (Why born a slave?).  addl accession","Maulleigh: la,Maulleigh: negresse,Maulleigh: carpeaux,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3276063360.jpg","-","img875","Photanic","Recent trip to the metropolitan museum of art","Photanic: museum,Photanic: metropolitan,Photanic: film,Photanic: hasselblad,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3282637964.jpg","-","at the Met","jamesprez","NA","NA,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3283296184.jpg","-","metro","cloudleo89","Masterpiece","cloudleo89: timewemet,cloudleo89: met,cloudleo89: metropolitan,cloudleo89: nyc,cloudleo89: time,cloudleo89: we,cloudleo89: museum,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3283296338.jpg","-","watt","cloudleo89","first attempt of me running away","cloudleo89: timewemet,cloudleo89: met,cloudleo89: metropolitan,cloudleo89: nyc,cloudleo89: time,cloudleo89: we,cloudleo89: museum,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3283373926.jpg","-","TheMap_TheMET(1)","rverc","Messenger, carrying Letters of Transit.","rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: nyc,rverc: met,rverc: ancientneareasternart,rverc: art,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3286506226.jpg","-","The Escalator","markrossphotography","Digitally repixelated time lapse photograph of friends amongst the crowds of art lovers at the Met, NYC.","markrossphotography: timewemet,markrossphotography: metropolitanmuseum,markrossphotography: movement,markrossphotography: color,markrossphotography: mixedmedia,markrossphotography: timelapse,markrossphotography: blur,markrossphotography: abstraction,markrossphotography: digitalrepixelation,markrossphotography: digitalart,markrossphotography: photography,markrossphotography: mixedmedium,markrossphotography: art,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3288098534.jpg","-","DSC01350","deyvis","NA","deyvis: timewemet,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3288098586.jpg","-","DSC01342","deyvis","NA","deyvis: timewemet,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3289315822.jpg","-","time_we_met.","alessia_sf","NA","alessia_sf: timewemet,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3289857041.jpg","-","Marina","any.nyc","Metropolitan Museum of Art","any.nyc: timewemet,any.nyc: nvny,Description,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3290720306.jpg","-","Roman Gallery","Joe Josephs: 1,355,720 views -

Foggini, the leading sculptor of the Florentine Baroque. While strong echoes of Bernini date the creation of the bust to shortly after the younger artist's return from Rome, it already exhibits Foggini's talent for the depiction of material opulence that earned him the post of Medici court sculptor. Dynamic contrasts abound: the fragile lace cravat and lavish mantle (emulating modes of the contemporary French court) set off the realistically depicted face. Foggini's artistic genius inaugurated the final flourish of Medici patronage. This bust, modeled from life, was followed by a series portraying other family members, all intended to promote the political aspirations of the fading dynasty.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3172498384.jpg","55.11.5","LNYCart418","qpkarl","At the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;Marble sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons;Roman, Late Imperial, Gallienic, ca.

An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). The figures are unusual in that the Seasons are usually portrayed as women, but here they are shown as sturdy youths. Around these five central figures are placed other Bacchic figures and cultic objects, all carved at a smaller scale. On the rounded ends of the sarcophagus are two other groups of large figures, similarly intermingled with lesser ones. On the left end, Mother Earth is portrayed reclining on the ground; she is accompanied by a satyr and a youth carrying fruit. On the right end, a bearded male figure, probably to be identified with the personification of a river-god, reclines in front of two winged youths, perhaps representing two additional Seasons. ;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,DescriptionInDesc,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3172499452.jpg","1989.407","LNYCart404","qpkarl","At the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;The Burghers of Calais (detail), modeled 188495; this bronze cast 1985;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin rel=nofollow>Auguste Rodin</a> (French, 18401917);Bronze; H. 82 1/2 in.

Gerald Cantor, 1989 (1989.407);;The Burghers of Calais, commemorating an episode during the Hundred Years' War between England and France, is probably the best and certainly the most successful of Rodin's public monuments. Rodin closely followed the account of the French chronicler Jean Froissart (1333 or 1337after 1400) stating that six of the principal citizens of Calais were ordered to come out of their besieged city with head and feet bare, ropes around their necks, and the keys of the town and the caste in their hands. They were brought before the English king Edward III (13121377), who ordered their beheading. Rodin has portrayed them at the moment of departure from their city led by Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the bearded man in the middle of the group. At his side, Jean d'Aire carres a giant-sized key. Their oversized feet are bare, many have ropes around their necks, and all are in various states of despair, expecting imminent death and unaware that their lives will ultimately be saved by the intercession of the English queen Philippa. The arrangement of the group, with its unorthodox massing and subtle internal rhythms, was not easily settled, and the completed monument, cast in bronze by the Le Blanc-Barbedienne foundry, was not unveiled in Calais until 1895. The Metropolitan Museum's bronze is a lost-wax casting made from the plaster model in the Musee Rodin in Paris;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3172502226.jpg","63.40","LNYCart426","qpkarl","At the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist rel=nofollow>Saint John the Baptist</a>;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Martinez_Montanes rel=nofollow>Juan Martinez Montanes</a> (Spanish, 15681649);Gilt and polychromed wood; H. 61 in.

This figure, which dates from about 162535, came from the convent of Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion. It has for its compositional precedent Montanes's own Baptist of the main altar in San Isidoro del Campo at Santiponce, made between 1609 and 1613. The Museum's Baptist is, however, a fuller and more emotionally charged figure. In fact, it has been called Montanes's most beautiful single figure.

At the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;Barye is best known for his more Romantic bronzes of animals, but as a student of the Neoclassical sculptor Francois-Joseph Bosio (1768-1845), he received a thorough grounding in the classical tradition. Ovid recounts the Battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs in his Metamorphoses. Book XII describes how Theseus, ruler of Athens, helped the king of the Lapiths by violently slaying the centaur Bianor.;;Barye exhibited a large plaster of Theseus Combating the Centaur Bianor at the Salon of 1850, after which bronzes in various sizes were cast. Barye must have been aware of the metopes from the Parthenon depicting the Greek legend, but this specific modeling of the death blow delivered by the Greek hero was clearly borrowed from the marble Hercules Slaying a Centaur (1595-1600, Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence) by the Mannerist sculptor Giovanni Bologna (1529-1608).;;Around 1846-48, Barye had already made an initial sketch of the same subject which was later also cast. The versions differ substantially, resulting in the more horizontally oriented composition of the later work. The rock formation beneath the horse is slightly higher, the centaur's upper torso leans further back, and its left front leg is more contracted. The tip of the tail is curled inwards, and the centaur's hair flows differently than in the earlier sketch. In all, these changes give the later work a greater sense of agony and better express the fierceness of the battle.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3172505168.jpg","11.173.1","LNYCart434","qpkarl","At the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam rel=nofollow>Adam</a>, modeled in 1880; this bronze case in 1910;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin rel=nofollow>Auguste Rodin</a> (French, 18401917);Bronze; 76 1/4 x 29 1/2 x 30 1/2 in.

The direct experience of the Renaissance master's art, both in Italy and in the Musee du Louvre in Paris, seems to have unlocked for Rodin many of the secrets of Michelangelo's modeling. Here they are used to convey the inner anguish and riveted concentration of a powerful but immobilized being. Two of Michelangelo's works explain the meaning as well as the genesis of the strange gestures Rodin gave to Adam, for as Albert Elsen observed in the catalogue for an exhibition titled Rodin at the Museum of Modern Art in New York: the right arm alludes to The Creation of Man, the Sistine Chapel fresco in the Vatican; the left is borrowed from the dead Christ of the Pieta in the Cathedral of Florence.

With their himation-like draped swags, these designs are a relaxed version of the fine dense pleating that generally covers her fitted, highly structured bodices. The technical virtuosity incorporated in the draping is revealed only on close study of this example. The swags are both continuous and unbroken panels of fabric that incorporate the right fronts and backs of the gown. In her neoclassicism, Gres conformed to the antique notion of uninterrupted lengths of cloth, stitched but not cut into shape. From her earliest work, Gres introduced windows onto the body with cutouts that bared the back and midriff. The dense draping of the handkerchief-weight jersey in the gown provides carefully positioned coverage. At either side of the hips and legs, however, only a taut layer of fabric is provided for a sensuous disclosure of the body's contours.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3174063515.jpg","1992.212a-e","LNYCart457","qpkarl","A somewhat <a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grisly rel=nofollow>grisly</a> sculpture at the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;Robert Arneson (American, 19301992);Ground Zero;1983;Bronze;H. 24, W. 82, D. 82 inches (61 x 208.3 x 208.3 cm.)

Jackson sat for Powers in a room next to the president's sitting room in the White House. The model, which was completed in several sittings by January 1835, realistically depicts the sixty-seven-year-old Jackson with his head and gaze turned to his left, his long lean face deeply marked with wrinkles, his mouth and cheeks sunken from lack of teeth, and his creased forehead set off by a shock of thick, brushed-back hair.

His long career began when the Queen Anne style was paramount and lasted through the early stages of the Rococo in the 1730s to the extravagantly energetic phase of the style in the 1740s. This loving cup, silver-gilt throughout, is an example of the full-blown Rococo of the early 1740s, of which Lamerie was the leading exponent. The bell-shaped cup with a pear-shaped &quot;dropped bottom&quot; is completely covered with chased ornament. The figure and most of the surrounding applied ornament allude to the young Bacchus as the god of wine. The ribbed handles are vine branches and the cover finial is a bunch of grapes. The arms of the owner, a member of the Hodgson family, are engraved on the side, with the motto &quot;Pax et Fides&quot; (Peace and Faith).;Lamerie maintained a busy workshop that catered to London clientele but also exported much of its product to Europe, particularly Russia.

Despite the loss, which may have occurred when this massively thick-walled bronze was wrenched from the place it occupied, the planar compositional arrangements of the mother are fully visible and quite ingratiating.;;In 1595, the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi recommended his fellow Vicentine, Camillo Mariani, to Francesco Maria II della Rovere, duke of Urbino. The following year, &quot;the Venetian sculptor,&quot; whom scholars reasonably identify with Mariani, was paid for labor and materials &quot;for the apes of the fountain of Miralfore.&quot; The latter is the villa in Pesaro, still extant, that served the duke as hunting lodge and guesthouse. Its waterworks were centered on the fountain, of which Mother Ape was the crowning element. Water flowed from the wide hole near her left shoulder; her prehensile left foot is poised as if to test the water in the fountain's basin. Three lesser apes that also belonged to this fountain are now in the Boboli Gardens in Florence, having arrived there among possessions inherited by the duke's granddaughter, Vittoria della Rovere, when she married Ferdinando II de' Medici. ;;The Miralfore fountain, revealing a phenomenal gift for naturalism, comprised Mariani's only known exercise in animal sculpture and his sole work in bronze. Before and after, he worked chiefly in stucco, most notably after his move to Rome. The eight colossal stucco saints by him in the Roman church of San Bernardo alle Terme (1599-1600) are among the most arresting and profoundly spiritual portrayals of the late Counter-Reformation era.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3175973476.jpg","-","LNYCart550","qpkarl","I believe this is by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas rel=nofollow>Degas</a>.

(120.6 x 99.6 cm);Rogers Fund, 1912 (12.130.1);;Veit Stoss of Nuremberg was one of the most influential German artists of the Late Gothic era. This work by one of his pupils most likely dates from Stoss's residence in Cracow, where he maintained a thriving workshop for nearly twenty years before returning to Nuremberg in 1496. The composition was adapted from an engraving by Martin Schongauer of the Baptism of Christ. It probably once included the figures of God the Father and the dove of the Holy Spirit shown blessing the event in accordance with scripture: &quot;He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him; and a voice from heaven was heard saying, 'This is my Son, my Beloved, on whom my favor rests'&quot; (Matthew 3:1617). John, dressed in his &quot;rough coat of camel hair,&quot; anoints Christ with the waters of the River Jordan while an attending angel waits with Christ's robe. The mannered flow of Christ's loincloth echoes the river's swirling current, as do the circular patterns suggested by the arrangement of the figures and their gestures. Originally, this work would have been part of an altarpiece; it is perhaps from a lateral wing composed of a much larger ensemble of scenes. The play of both candlelight and daylight over the relief would have enhanced the richness of the painted and gilded wood surfaces.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3249088794.jpg","26.7.1396","Fragment of the Face of a Queen, Head, Queen Tiye (?), ca. 13531336 B.C","Maulleigh","Fragment of the Face of a Queen, Head, Queen Tiye (?), ca. 13531336 B.C.; New Kingdom, Amarna Period;Egyptian; Amarna possibly; Middle Egypt;Yellow jasper; H. 13 cm (5 1/8 in); w. 12.5 cm (4 15/16 in); d. 12.5 cm (4 15/16 in);Purchase, Edward S.

In Egyptian artistic convention, the color yellow usually indicates a woman, and the scale and superb quality of the work implies that it represents a queen. The back of the piece shows remains of the mortise that fitted into a tenon extending from the statue's body, which may have been made of Egyptian alabaster to represent a white garment.;; ;Two headdresses might have fit this head, one of which is the so-called Nubian wig (like the one on a canopic jar lid in the Museum, Highlight #30), often worn by the women of Akhenaten's family. The royal woman represented here cannot be securely identified. It is difficult to imagine that Akhenaten's already aged mother, Queen Tiyehighly respected as a wise woman at Amarnawas shown as a beauty of such sensuous character. His principal queen, Nefertiti, and his secondary queen, Kiya, however, are both possible subjects.","Maulleigh: fragment,Maulleigh: face,Maulleigh: queen,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3264750924.jpg","-","Nefertiti","Tom Jolly","NA","Tom Jolly: nefertiti,Tom Jolly: newyorkcity,Tom Jolly: metropolitanmuseumofart,Tom Jolly: metropolitanmuseum,Tom Jolly: flickr,Tom Jolly: egytianart,Tom Jolly: queenofegypt,Tom Jolly: themostbeautifulwomanintheworld,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 40","3279131747.jpg","-","LbubNYCart398","qpkarl","<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugolino rel=nofollow>Ugolino</a> and his sons share some family time.
