(215.9 x 141.9 cm);Purchase, Mrs. Charles Wrightsman Gift, in memory of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, 1994 (1994.190);;This lifesize portrait of Talleyrand, a brilliant political figure who served under every French ruler from Louis XVI to Louis-Philippe, is the last of three by Prud'hon, who was a principal painter of Napoleon's court. The other canvases, depicting Talleyrand in court costume, were commissioned by Napoleon for the chateau de Compiegne in 1806 (Chateau de Valencay, Indre) and 1807 (Musee Carnavalet, Paris). After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, Talleyrand obtained the two earlier portraits and asked Prud'hon to repaint one showing him in civilian attire. The artist's notorious craquelure had already set in, so instead Prud'hon painted the present work, about April 1817.;;This canvas may be considered one of the most imposing of Prud'hon's formal portraits of the great personalities of the day. Showing Talleyrand not as an administrative official but as one of the extraordinary intellects of his time, Prud'hon presents the witty and treacherous ambassador as a savant: in a richly appointed room he leans on the pedestal of a bust of Marcus Aurelius while another (of Demosthenes?) looks on.","Maulleigh: charlesmaurice,Maulleigh: de,Maulleigh: talleyrandperigord,Maulleigh: pierrepaul,Maulleigh: prudhon,Maulleigh: talleyrand,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 39","3320624510.jpg","-","We Can Do That","geanate","Life imitating art.

(62.23 cm);Rogers Fund, 1914 (14.130.12);;This Panathenaic amphora would have been filled with oil from the sacred olive groves in Attica, and would have been awarded as a prize to some worthy victor in one of the Panathenaic games held in Athens every four years. With its typically fat body and small neck and foot, the prize vase is, perhaps, the best example of a vase shape made to serve an official function. Each Panathenaic amphora was made according to a standardized shape and capacity of one metretes (approximately 42 quarts), and was decorated in black-figure technique. The principle decoration is always in the panels of the body of the amphora, with an armed Athena typically on the front and an illustration of the featured competition on the back. ;;Foot races, the earliest competitions of the Olympic games, were undertaken over varying distances. The stadion, probably the original race, was a fast sprint over one length of the track (over 200 meters), while the diaulos and the dolichos, both introduced somewhat later, covered distances of approximately 400 meters and 1,400 to 3,800 meters, respectively. The painter of this vessel has neatly fit five sprintersfive men and a youthinto the panel of the pot. Notice the wealth of incised lines depicting musculature, a preoccupation of Greek artists for centuries to come.;;Orders for Panathenaic amphorae were placed with leading artists of the time. On the basis of style, this vessel has been attributed to the Euphiletos Painter. An inscription on the front of the amphora gives not only the official designation of the vase as a prize, but also the signature of the potter, Nikias, a rare occurrence on pots of this shape.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eusb/ho_14.130.12.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eusb/ho_14.130.12.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: amphora,ElissaSCA: archaic,decorative_object,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Decorative_Object""SET 39","3016767943.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting_and_sculpture,Artwork,3D","Sculpture""SET 39","3017592750.jpg","-","Period Room at the Met","Sneferu's Cat","NA","Sneferu's Cat: museum,Sneferu's Cat: art,Sneferu's Cat: timewemet,period_room,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Period_Room""SET 39","3017598366.jpg","-","Suicidal Museum Goer","Sneferu's Cat","NA","Sneferu's Cat: museum,Sneferu's Cat: art,Sneferu's Cat: timewemet,arms_armor,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Arms_Armor""SET 39","3312068981.jpg","-","-","-","-","NY - 2008,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 39","3311865103.jpg","-","-","-","-","arms_armor,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Arms_Armor""SET 39","3317821276.jpg","-","100_0407","kameikatricia","NA","kameikatricia: timewemet,arms_armor,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Arms_Armor""SET 39","3316504941.jpg","-","2","erinkidder","NA","erinkidder: timewemet,painting,Artwork,2D,Art2or3","Painting""SET 39","3318165024.jpg","-","Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England","Maulleigh","Steel, blackened, etched, and gilt: textile and leather;Italian (milan or Brescia), about 1544;;This impressive armor was made for Henry VIII (r. 1509-1547) toward the end of his life when he was overweight and crippled with gout.

The outcome of the conflict is indicated by the end of the spear preserved in the centaur's left flank and the greater height of the man.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: man,ElissaSCA: centaur,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: geometric,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Sculpture""SET 39","1010751697.jpg","-","-","-","-","sculpture,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Sculpture""SET 39","1036412928.jpg","-","-","-","-","sculpture,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Sculpture""SET 39","1116157809.jpg","03.11a-d","Detail of the Demidoff Table in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","La Table aux Amours (The Demidoff Table), 1845;Lorenzo Bartolini (Italian, 17771850);Marble; Diam. 54 in.

She may be dressed for a festival and the birds and basket of fruit she carries might be offerings. Her garment has slipped off her shoulder, a detail often seen in representations of old women that hints at the liberation of the elderly from the restrictions imposed on women of childbearing years. As in many such figures, direct observation of reality lends force to deeper religious implications. The piece may be a copy of an older, Hellenistic model or a creation of the Roman period in a tradition that was still alive.

It clearly belonged to an impressive, full-length statue, but despite a careful search of the find-spot, only some small fragments of the rest of the piece were found. The identification of the head as that of Marcus Agrippa appears to be confirmed by an inscribed stone base that was also discovered. ;;Agrippa was one of Augustus closest friends and supporters, who played a role in the civil wars during the 30s BC. ;;Thereafter, he acted almost as second-in-command to the emperor and as his roving ambassador, dealing with troubles in various parts of the Empire. Agrippa was rewarded with many titles and offices, including the consulship on three occasions, and in 21 BC, he married Augustus daughter Julia.

(185.42 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1925 (25.78.56);;This statue is known as a Diadoumenos, a youth tying a fillet around his head after a victory in an athletic contest. It is a first-century A.D. Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 430 B.C. The original bronze probably stood in a sanctuary such as that at Olympia or Delphi, where games were regularly held. Ancient literary accounts (Lucian, Philopseudes, 18; Pliny, N.H. xxxiv, 15) and over forty known copies attest to the original bronze being one of the most highly esteemed creations of Polykleitos, the renowned Greek sculptor from Argos who worked during the midfifth century B.C. Both in his sculpture and in a written text, the Canon, Polykleitos sought to represent the nude male figure with perfect harmony among all parts and according to principles that could be reproduced by others. He carefully designed his figures with special attention paid to bodily proportions and stance, so that the effect of the whole is singularly harmonious. The thorax and pelvis of the Diadoumenos tilt in opposite directions, setting up rhythmic contrasts in the torso that create an impression of organic vitality. The position of the feet poised between standing and walking give a sense of potential movement. This rigorously calculated pose, which is found in almost all works attributed to Polykleitos, became a standard formula used in Greco-Roman and, later, western European art.;;Of this marble copy, the head, arms, legs from the knees down, and tree trunk are ancient. The remainder of the figure was cast from a marble copy found at Delos and now in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The head is practically intact with even the nose unbroken. The sharply carved eyelids bordered by ridges suggesting lashes, the transverse incision on the lower lip, and the crisply carved curls indicate a faithful rendering of the bronze original.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/hod_25.78.56.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/hod_25.78.56.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: diadoumenos,ElissaSCA: polykleitos,ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: city,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: classical,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: youth,ElissaSCA: athlete,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: copy,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: empire,sculpture,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Sculpture""SET 39","942218930.jpg","32.11.4","Detail of the Wounded Amazon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  July 2007","ElissaSCA","Statue of a wounded Amazon, 1st2nd century A.D.;Roman copy of a Greek bronze statue, ca. 450425 B.C.;Marble (Pentelic); H. 80 1/4 in. (203.84 cm);Gift of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 1932 (32.11.4);;The Amazons were a mythical race of warrior women renowned for their skills in archery and horsemanship. This marble statue depicting a wounded Amazon is a Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 450425 B.C. The original bronze may have stood in the sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesus on the coast of Asia Minor, where the Amazons had legendary and cultic connections with the goddess.;;Here, the mythical warrior woman has been stripped of her weapons and horse, and wounded under her right breast. She wears a short, sleeveless chiton unfastened at one shoulder and belted at the waist with a makeshift bit of bridle from her horse. The garment is known as an exomis, the type of clothing worn by Greek men for exercise, horse riding, or hard labor. Despite her plight, this Amazon shows no sign of pain or fatigue. She gently leans on the pillar at her left and rests her right arm gracefully on her head in a gesture often used to denote sleep or death. The serenity of her pose and the emotional restraint in her facial expression are characteristic of Classical sculpture of the second half of the fifth century B.C.;;The Roman writer Pliny the Younger describes a competition held in the mid-fifth century B.C. between five famous sculptors, including Pheidias, Polykleitos, and Kresilas, who were to make a statue of an Amazon for the temple of Artemis. This type of statue, which is reproduced in other marble copies, is generally associated with that contest.;;Of this marble copy, the lower legs and feet have been restored with plaster casts taken from other marble copies of this type in Berlin and Copenhagen. Most of the right, the lower end of the left forearm, the lower part of the pillar, and the plinth are eighteenth-century marble restorations. However, the sharply carved facial features and the crisply carved curls indicate a faithful rendering of the bronze original.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/god1/hod_32.11.4.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/god1/hod_32.11.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: classical,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: amazon,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: copy,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: challengeyouwinner,sculpture,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Sculpture""SET 39","957364427.jpg","56.234.15","Marble Statue of Hermes in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble statue of Hermes;Roman, Imperial Period, 1st or 2nd century AD;Copy or adaptation of a Greek statue of the late 5th or early 4th century BC;The left hand, tip of the nose, and tips of some fingers on the right hand are restored.;;Accession # 56.234.15;;The statue is almost intact, although the surface was strongly cleaned as was the custom in the 18th century.
