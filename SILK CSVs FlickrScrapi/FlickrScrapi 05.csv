In the center, Selene, the moon goddess, alights from her chariot to visit her beloved, the shepherd Endymion, who reclines at the right. Endymion, most beautiful of men, has been granted eternal youth and eternal sleep. A female figure stands over him, pouring out the magic potion of immortality and holding a bunch of sleep-inducing poppies. The scene is flanked on the left end of the sarcophagus by a rising Helios, the sun god, and on the right by a descending Selene, each in a chariot.

In addition to its very high quality, this saddle is also exceptional for having all of its original parts, including the elaborate seat cover of embroidered silk and the fittings of the saddletree. Although this type of saddle is often identified as Tibetan, the form of the saddle plates, the style of workmanship, and the type of saddletree, along with the similarity to imperial Chinese saddles, indicate it is more likely to be Chinese, perhaps from the imperial workshops. That it was used in Tibet, however, is demonstrated by the Tibetan letter ka, which is branded on the underside of the saddletree as a form of inventory number. It must have belonged to a Tibetan nobleman of the highest rank, possibly received as a gift directly from the imperial court. The saddle plates are made from relatively thick iron, deeply chiseled and pierced, the motifs densely arranged so that the gaps in the scrollwork are narrow. The plates are finely crosshatched and damascened overall with a thick layer of gold foil. The beads of coral and ivory in the center of the pommel and cantle are popular Buddhist symbols called the Three Jewels, representing Buddha, Dharma (Buddhist teachings), and Sangha (the community of believers).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/40004933 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/4000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: saddle,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,Artwork,decorative_object","Decorative_Object""SET 05","7177708425.jpg","12.231.2","Terracotta Kylix Signed by Euphronios as Potter and Attributed to Onesimos as Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, April 2011","ElissaSCA","Terracotta kylix (drinking cup);;Signed by Euphronios: Attributed to Onesimos ;;Period: Late Archaic ;;Date: ca. 490 B.C. ;;Culture: Greek, Attic ;;Medium: Terracotta ;;Dimensions: H. with handle 4 15/16 in.

It is thought that billowing clouds of smoke, produced by the burning of copal incense, accompanied every major ceremony in the Maya realm. Depicted on the censer illustrated here is a seated figure, perhaps a ruler, surrounded by aspects of mythological creatures that are stacked about his head and symmetrically flank his sides. The central figure is in higher relief, sitting cross-legged with arms carefully positioned in front of his chest. The position of the hands, held inward and touching, is known from sculpted stone monuments, where it carries connotations of rulership. A human head or masklike element is depicted in the figure's lap. The figure may represent a generalized concept of revered ancestor.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50007223 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/5000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: mayan,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: pottery,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 05","7033790569.jpg","-","young hercules","branko_","Roman, Flavian, first century A.D.;;On his left hand, Hercules holds an apple, a golden apple from The Garden of the Hesperides.;In this garden, there was a single apple tree or a grove, where the golden apples gave immortality.;Ladon, a sleepless and hundred-headed serpent (dragon), safeguarded the tree.;;Gen 3:4 &quot;You will not surely die,&quot; the serpent said to the woman. ;5 &quot;For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&quot;;;&quot;Extraordinary strength, courage, ingenuity, and sexual prowess with both males and females were among his characteristic attributes.&quot;;Warrior similar to a Samurai, who has a male lover-assistant.;Kind of like a &quot;Prince of the Church&quot;; who has a leaning for young boys.;Better yet, Hercules is Nimrod.;Nimrod who built Babylon, attempted to construct Babel's Tower, started a Babylonian religion which after thousands of years is alive and well, as Roman Catholicism. ;;Genesis 10:9;he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said, `As Nimrod the hero [in] hunting before Jehovah.'","branko_: young,branko_: hercules,branko_: branko,branko_: leica,branko_: m9,branko_: metropolitan,branko_: museum,branko_: art,branko_: manhattan,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: nyc,branko_: lion,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 05","7222971156.jpg","-","met","branko_","branko;<a href=http://www.a2b1.com rel=nofollow>www.a2b1.com</a>;youtube channel: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/a2b1 rel=nofollow>www.youtube.com/a2b1</a>","branko_: metropolitan,branko_: museum,branko_: art,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: ancient,branko_: roman,branko_: lion,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 05","7222971518.jpg","03.23.1","met the monteleone chariot","branko_","branko;<a href=http://www.a2b1.com rel=nofollow>www.a2b1.com</a>;youtube channel: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/a2b1 rel=nofollow>www.youtube.com/a2b1</a>  addl Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory Date: 2nd quarter of the 6th century B.C.

This agonizingly expressive bust of Marsyas, carved in Italy early in his career, reveals his absorption of the style of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and forecasts the distinctive manner Permoser would develop in his native country. The tortured expression of the screaming satyr Marsyas, flayed alive after losing a musical contest with the god Apollo, responds especially to Bernini's Damned Soul of 1619. The savage face riven by clenched brows and eyes squinting in pain, however, is distinctly the sculptor's own creation. Deliberately rough, flamelike hair contrasts excruciatingly precise details like the torn tongue. The bust's unfinished back and emplacement for a bracket suggest that it was originally intended for a niche, perhaps in a palace courtyard.;; branko;<a href=http://www.a2b1.com rel=nofollow>www.a2b1.com</a>;youtube channel: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/a2b1 rel=nofollow>www.youtube.com/a2b1</a>  addl  Marsyas Balthasar Permoser (German, Kammer, near Otting, Chiemgau, Bavaria 1651–1732 Dresden) Date: ca. 1680–85 Medium: Marble on a black marble socle inlaid with light marble panels Accession Number: 2002.468 On view in Gallery 548","branko_: marsias,branko_: metropolitan,branko_: museum,branko_: art,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: bust,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 05","7250577774.jpg","1978.431","Eros Bone Plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2011","ElissaSCA","Plaque with an Eros;;Date: 4th5th century ;;Geography: Made in, Byzantine Egypt ;;Culture: Coptic ;;Medium: Bone, traces of red and blue paint ;;Dimensions: Overall: 3 9/16 x 2 3/8 x 3/16 in.

It is conceivable that a king (her father, son, or husband) was originally represented seated beside her. The sculpture has been identified tentatively as Queen Ahmes Nefertari, mother of Amenhotep I, and dated to the reign of Ahmose (ca. 1550-1525 B.C.) at the very beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty. However, the remarkable flatness of the face and wig is familiar from certain works created during the Seventeenth Dynasty (compare the seated statueof Siamun in gallery 11), and the intriguing interplay of fleshy musculature in the lower part of the face is even reminiscent of late Middle Kingdom images. This combination of stylistic traits is best understood in the context of the excitingly multifaceted artistic period between the end of the Middle and the beginning of the New Kingdom.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/100000741 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fragment,ElissaSCA: queen,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 05","7324195246.jpg","1996.27","Lilith TheMET(4)","rverc","Kiki Smith American, born 1954;;<b><i> Lilith </i></b> , 1994;Bronze with glass eyes;;Purchase , Roy R. and Marie S.

With the assistance of Shamash and Adad, the gods who help me, I thundered like Adad the destroyer over the troops of the Nairi lands, Habhi, Shubaru, and Nirib.

With the assistance of Shamash and Adad, the gods who help me, I thundered like Adad the destroyer over the troops of the Nairi lands, Habhi, Shubaru, and Nirib. I am the king who had brought into submission at his feet the lands from beyond the Tigris to Mount Lebanon and the Great Sea [the Mediterranean], the whole of the land of Laqe, the land of Suhi as far as Rapiqu, and whose hand has conquered from the source of the river Subnat to the land of Urartu.;;The area from the mountain passes of Kirruri to the land of Gilzanu, from beyond the Lower Zab to the city of Til-Bari which is north of the land of Zaban, from the city of Til-sha-abtani to Til-sha-Zabdani, Hirimu and Harutu, fortresses of the land of Karduniash [Babylonia], I have restored to the borders of my land. From the mountain passes of Babite to the land of Hashmar I have counted the inhabitants as peoples of my land. Over the lands which I have subjugated I have appointed my governors, and they do obeisance.;;I am Ashurnasirpal, the celebrated prince, who reveres the great gods, the fierce dragon, conqueror of the cities and mountains to their furthest extent, king of rulers who has tamed the stiff-necked peoples, who is crowned with splendor, who is not afraid of battle, the merciless champion who shakes resistance, the glorious king, the shepherd, the protection of the whole world, the king, the word of whose mouth destroys mountains and seas, who by his lordly attack has forced fierce and merciless kings from the rising to the setting sun to acknowledge one rule.;;The former city of Kalhu [Nimrud], which Shalmaneser king of Assyria, a prince who preceded me, had built, that city had fallen into ruins and lay deserted. That city I built anew, I took the peoples whom my hand had conquered from the lands which I subjugated, from the land of Suhi, from the land of Laqe, from the city of Sirqu on the other side of the Euphrates, from the furthest extent of the land of Zamua, from Bit-Adini and the land of Hatte, and from Lubarna, king of the land of Patina, and made them settle there.;;I removed the ancient mound and dug down to the water level. I sank the foundations 120 brick courses deep.
