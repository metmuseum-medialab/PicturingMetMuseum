(64.1 x 41.9 cm);;Classification: Paintings;;Credit Line: Marquand Collection, Gift of Henry G. Marquand, 1889;;Accession Number: 89.15.19;;;Catalogue Entry:;;This is one of the defining works of Italian portraiture: the earliest surviving double portrait, the first to place the female sitter in a notional interior, and the first to include a landscape background. Each of these novelties was to be taken up and developed by artists only later in the century. Lippi has left us a number of altarpieces that include donor portraits, and these allow us confidently to date this work to about 144044, contemporary with the Annunciation in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome. That altarpiece also provides close analogies for the landscape seen through a window. Although there is the possibility that the picture was commissioned to celebrate the birth of a child, the sumptuous clothes and many rings worn by the woman are appropriate for a bride, as is the motto lealta (loyalty) embroidered in gold threads and seed pearls on her ermine-lined sleeve. The male is no less expensively garbed in scarlet and wears a hat designating his high social rank. On the basis of the coat of arms displayed by the male sitter, Breck [see Ref. 1913] tentatively identified the couple as the Florentine Lorenzo di Ranieri Scolari (a relation of the celebrated general Pippo Spano) and Angiola di Bernardo Sapiti, who are usually said to have been married in 1436 [see Pompeo Litta, Familie celebri di italia, Milan, 181983, fasc. LXVII (1850), disp. 122, tav. I and IV]; however, according to Katalin Prajda [correspondence in departmental archive file], they were still unmarried in 1439. Although the dark pigment of the coat of arms is a deteriorated blue rather than the expected black, Prajda notes that the Scolari employed a number of variations. She is currently pursuing the possibility that the Scolari coat of arms here may have been intended to identify the female rather than the male sitter.;;In this innovative portrait, Lippi retains the conventional profile view of both sitters but includes their hands. As with most later portraits, he situates the female in a domestic interior, the box-like shape and steeply foreshortened ceiling of which are plainly adopted from depictions of the Madonna and Child (Donatello's so-called Pazzi Madonna in the Bodemuseum, Berlin, and Scheggia's Madonna and Child with Two Angels in the Museo Horne, Florence). By contrast, the male stands outside the room, gazing through a lateral window opening, while a second window offers a view onto a landscape that, it has been suggested, may record property belonging to the family.;;The degree to which Lippi has generalized the features of the sitters is as notable as the implausibility of the &quot;room&quot; that encases the woman. One need only compare their features with the portraits he includes in the roughly contemporary Coronation of the Virgin (Uffizi, Florence) to see the extent to which detailed physiognomic description has been suppressed. The difference in intent comes to the fore if Lippi's portrait is compared to Petrus Christus's 1446 portrait of Edward Grimston (collection of Lord Verulam, on loan to the National Gallery, London), in which the highly individualized sitter is placed in a far more plausible room, with careful attention to the light falling through the panes of a circular leaded-glass window. This comparison is important, since there has been a persistent attempt to link Lippi's innovations to his awareness of Netherlandish practice.;;Lippi's two figures occupy different planes in space, with the female figure dominant and the male in a subordinate positionas an observer. Examination with infrared reflectography demonstrates that the artist carefully rethought the placement of the woman's hands, one over the other, to achieve an effect of demure self-pos","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: renaissance,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: lippi,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 14","6062566462.jpg","32.100.71","-","ElissaSCA","Artist: Davide Ghirlandaio (David Bigordi) (Italian, Florence 14521525 Florence);;Title: Selvaggia Sassetti (born 1470);;Date: ca. 148788;;Medium: Tempera on wood;;Dimensions: 22 1/2 x 17 3/8 in.

(41.5 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1956 (56.171.38);;This red-figure amphora attributed to the Berlin Painter beautifully illustrates the symbiosis between the shape of a vase and its decoration. As one of the leading vase painters of the fifth century B.C., the Berlin Painter abandoned the rigid frames of panels on the amphora so that the contour of the vase itself focuses our attention on his solitary figures. On this particular vase, a musician in a long, slim garment accompanies himself on the kithara, a musical instrument used for formal performances in festivals and contests. The young musician, known as a kitharode, spreads the fingers of his left hand behind the strings and prepares to strike them with the plektron, or pick, in his right hand. The muscles in his neck stretch as he throws back his head and opens his mouth to sing. The sash below his kithara sways with the rhythm of his song. On the reverse side of the amphora, an instructor or, possibly, a judge listens intently and extends his right arm toward the young musician.;;The kithara was an instrument with seven strings of equal length and a solidly built, wooden body, usually with a flat base. Strings of gut or sinew were stretched from a holder at the base of the instrument over a bridge to the crossbar that joined the two sidepieces. The kitharode, who always stood while playing, made music by stroking the plektron in his right hand across the strings, sounding all those not damped with his left fingers. During performances, the instrument rested against the musician's shoulder, and was supported by a sling that wrapped around the left wrist. The musician could regulate pitch by the tension and, perhaps, thickness of the strings.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grmu/hod_56.171.38.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grmu/hod_56.171.38.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: amphora,ElissaSCA: berlinpainter,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: redfigure,ElissaSCA: archaic,Art2or3,3D,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 14","2451574527.jpg","17.190.685-87","Chasse of Champagnat in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2008","ElissaSCA","Chasse of Champagnat;Engraved copper-gilt; champleve enamel;French, Limoges, ca. 1150;;Accession Numbers: 17.190.685-87, 695, 710-11;;The important place accorded to Saint Martial on this chasse reflects the distinctly Limousin conviction that the region's first bishop should be ranked with the Apostles.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: romanesque,ElissaSCA: middleages,ElissaSCA: coppper,ElissaSCA: enamel,Art2or3,3D,AccessionInDesc,Description,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 14","2753219207.jpg","74.51.659","Cypriot Terracotta Ring Kernos in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Terracotta ring-kernos (offering vase);Cypriot, Cypro-Geometric I, White Painted Ware I, ca. 1050-950 BC;;From the Cesnola Collection, Accession # 74.51.659;;There are small holes in the bull's head and the cups that allowed liquid to flow into the hollow, horizontal ring.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: geometric,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: kernos,Art2or3,3D,AccessionInDesc,Description,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 14","3987135833.jpg","81.10.222","Green Roman Glass in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2009","ElissaSCA","Glass beaker;;Period: Early Imperial ;;Date: 1st century A.D. ;;Culture: Roman ;;Medium: Glass ;;Dimensions: diameter 2 1/2in.

Because when you are sharing your body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. You two are the only ones in the entire universe.

(19.05 cm);Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Klaus G. Perls, 1991 (1991.17.138) ;;This magnificent ivory bracelet was the possession of a chief from the Yoruba kingdom of Owo. Scholars have suggested that items like this were worn at Ore, a ceremony that celebrated the kingdom's origins at Ife, the cradle of Yoruba civilization.;;Twin chiefly characters bearing wrappers, beaded necklaces, and distinctive coiffures appear on either side of the bracelet, surrounded by a host of smaller figures organized along two registers. The figures are divided equally into upside-down and right-side-up sections, so that they can be &quot;read&quot; properly by both the bracelet's wearer and the observer. The repertory of subjects depicted include attendants, flute players, bound captives, equestrian warriors, and foot soldiers with severed heads. These figures illustrate the prerogatives and duties of chiefly life, suggesting an opulent existence built upon political power and military achievement. Aquatic imagery, in the form of two crocodiles and a human figure with mudfish legs, emphasize the ruler's relationship to Olokun, the god of the sea who brings wealth and fertility to his adherents. This connection is reinforced by the ivory's whiteness, which suggests the foam of the sea. Two pipe-smoking figures with elongated coiffures can be identified as the deity Eshu, a trickster figure who facilitates communication between the human and supernatural worlds. The appearance of this supernatural intercessor in conjunction with symbols of Olokun indicates the strong and productive nature of the relationship the ruler enjoys with the sea deity.;;The approach evident in this bracelet's carving is characteristic of the style associated with Owo. The flattened faces, heavy-lidded eyes, inlaid pupils, and conical coiffures of projecting elements are typical of Owo ivories, as are the pierced, openwork style and use of a two-tiered composition.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1991.17.138 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1991.17.138</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: african,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bracelet,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: ivory,Art2or3,3D,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 14","6083337364.jpg","1978.412.394","Memorial Head in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2010","ElissaSCA","Memorial Head, 19th20th century;Cote d'Ivoire; Akan, Anyi subgroup;Terracotta ;H. 10 3/8 in.

When a ruler died, a memorial sculpture was created in his likeness and brought to the cemetery in which he was buried. It was left there with images created for previous generations of rulers, forming a display that was the focus of annual rites celebrating the memory of the royal ancestors. Sculptures of servants and courtiers such as this one were also left near the burial site, where they served to comfort and support the deceased in the afterlife.;;The unusual brimmed hat may indicate the courtly status of this royal servant.

The design and spirit of the &quot;gondola,&quot; a contemporary term for this ceramic type of a woman in a bath, suggest it was intended to be decorative rather than utilitarian. Employing Palissy's saturated color glazes, textured waves, and shell-like lobes, the piece also hints at the erotic nature of court art through its high-relief rendering of the nude female figure. The partly submerged woman personifying a spring was a popular theme at the court of Fontainebleau, itself named after a local water source, which numerous potters imitating Palissy's style in the nearby village of Avon frequently employed. Palissy himself, known principally for his innovative rustic ceramics, demonstrated an interest in this motif through his numerous works bearing representations of water.

An inner border encircles the scene with floral designs, while the outer border contains panels with images of birds and ladies, echoing the central motif. The design on this plate is a modified version of a drawing by a Dutch artist named Cornelis Pronk, originally depicting Chinese ladies in the same setting. Pronk was commissioned by the Dutch East India Company to create a design for tea and dinner sets for Chinese potters to use as a model. At some point, this design made its way to Japan, where Pronk's original design was altered to reflect Japanese fashions instead of Chinese.

(34 x 31.8 x 14.6 cm);Classification;Ceramics-Sculpture;;Seated, life-size baby figures are among the most intriguing ceramic works from Precolumbian Mexico. Although their human features and postures are not symbolically complex and are easily understood, the significance of these figures in Precolumbian times is far from clear. They may have been early forms of Mexican deities or emblems of royal descent, or both. Made by an intellectually and artistically gifted people now called Olmec, the baby figures are white-surfacedif not entirely made of white clayand hollow. Some portray well-fed children making infantile gestures. Holding a chubby finger to its mouth, this figure is a fine example. An elaborate helmet (or perhaps a special hair arrangement) is colored red-pink with powdered cinnabar and red ochre that was probably used for symbolic purposes.;;Most intact Olmec ceramics have been found in burials in the central Mexican highlands. Preservation conditions in the wet climate of the Gulf Coast, where the Olmecs built their main centers, are so poor that the acid soils erode even well-fired ceramic objects. This figure is said to come from the highland site of Las Bocas in Puebla.  addl Seated Figure Date: 12th–9th century B.C.

Several unrelated ancient works were often combined in order to make a complete statue. Here, the portrait head of a Roman woman, her hair arranged in a style fashionable in the late 1st century AD, was placed on a damaged statue of a goddess known as Tyche in Greek and as Fortuna in Latin. She is recognizable by her attributesa cornucopia and a ships rudderwhich symbolize the prosperity she could bestow and her power to steer and control events. The statue was acquired in the late eighteenth century by the British statesman William Fitzmaurice, second earl of Shelburne, who, as Home Secretary, oversaw the end of the American War of Independence and the recognition of the United States. He assembled a distinguished collection of antiquities at Lansdowne House in London, where this statue of Tyche-Fortuna once stood in a niche in the dining room.

They resided in the west known as Cihuatlampa, or region of the women, and accompanied the sun daily from its zenith at midday to dusk on the western horizon. The Cihuateteo were the female counterparts of warriors who had perished on the battlefield and who were thought to escort the sun through the underworld to its rise each morning. On five specific days of the Aztec ritual calendar these malevolent female spirits were believed to descend to the earth and haunt crossroads hoping to snatch the young children they were never privileged to have. The sign for one of these days, &quot;1 Calli&quot; (1 House), is carved on the top of the figure's head. The sculpture is one of several equally fine, identical images of the goddess that have differing date glyphs on the top of their heads.

Striated face masks known as kifwebe probably originated in North Shaba, an area inhabited by both Songye and Luba groups. Significant departures in the role and formal interpretation of this art form subsequently developed in each culture. Among the small Songye chiefdoms along the Lomami River, maskers were emissaries of the ruling elite, who relied on the ideology of witchcraft and sorcery to sustain their rule. These kifwebe members commanded a body of esoteric secret knowledge visually encoded mnemonically in the mask's features.

Such representations are part of a complex of art forms which afforded access to influential ancestors and which were also appreciated for their aesthetic excellence.;;This idealized image of a leader once constituted the central protagonist of such a grouping.

This annual celebration coincides with the conclusion of the main harvest in late December or early January.; addl Helmet Mask Date: before 1880 Medium: Wood, copper, glass beads, raffia, cowrie shells Accession Number: 1978.412.560 On view in Gallery 352","christiNYCa: metmuseum,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: metropolitan,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: art,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: artsofafrica,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 14","6124253860.jpg","-","NYC - Met Museum: Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: metmuseum,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: metropolitan,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: art,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: artsofafrica,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 14","6124283680.jpg","1978.412.625","NYC - Met Museum: Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas","christiNYCa","NA  addl Headdress: Ram Date: 19th–20th century Medium: Wood, hide, twine, cloth, nails, pigment, wood slats, cane Accession Number: 1978.412.625 On view in Gallery 352","christiNYCa: metmuseum,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: metropolitan,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: art,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: artsofafrica,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 14","6124310192.jpg","2011.154.4","NYC - Met Museum: Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas","christiNYCa","Title;Crooked Beak of Heaven Mask;Date;late 19th century;Culture;Kwakwaka'wakw;Geography;Canada, British Columbia;Medium;Wood, plant fiber, cord, pigment;Dimensions;H. 18 1/4 x L. 40 1/8 in.

(95.2 cm);Bequest of Mary Clark Thompson, 1923 (26.229);;Constantine was the first Christian emperor of Rome, and his reign had a profound effect on the subsequent development of the Roman, and later Byzantine, world. Constantine's reign marked a distinct shift away from the administrative system set up by the emperor Diocletian in 293 A.D., which saw the division of the empire into four territories each governed by one of four imperial partners. This Tetrarchy was founded on the idea of homogeneous authority; all four emperors were depicted together in portraits emphasizing their unity and indivisibility in order to bolster their strength and present the image of a unified empire. Although Diocletian's intent had been to permanently do away with dynastic succession, Constantine's aim was to establish a new dynasty and to found a new capital, named Constantinople after himself. He also succeeded in reunifying the empire with the defeat of the last of his former tetrarchic colleagues, the Eastern emperor Licinius.;;Although the court and administration no longer resided at Rome, Constantine was careful not to neglect the old imperial city and adorned it with many new secular and Christian buildings. The most famous of these is the triumphal arch, the Arch of Constantine, which still stands near the Colosseum. This work contains reused material from earlier monuments, a practice that was not only economical but probably also intended to shed reflected glory on the emperor by associating his reign in a very direct and practical way with that of famous &quot;good&quot; emperors from the past. This desire to link himself to his revered predecessors greatly influenced Constantine's official portraiture, and contributed to the revival of certain classicizing features that had been absent from imperial portraiture for over a century.;;The full breadth of Constantine's portraiture demonstrates a remarkable evolution: early coin portraits show him in the manner of the Tetrarchs with a stubble beard and blocky physique, while later portraits such as this one, made after his assumption of sole power, show a significant change. In an effort to disassociate himself from his immediate predecessors, Constantine adopted an official image that recalled the calm, youthful faces of Augustus and Trajan. This colossal portrait head once surmounted an enormous statue of the seated emperor, and displays many features characteristic of Augustan and Trajanic portraiture. Most notably, Constantine is clean-shaven and his cap of hair is thick and arranged in comma-shaped locks across his forehead (compare this with the portrait head of Augustus (07.286.115). As part of his plan to reorganize the empire, Constantine's portraiture offered a new iconography to match his new regime.;;This monumental head, as in smaller portraits and coins of Constantine, presents the emperor as detached from the real world. It lacks the intimacy and individual expressiveness of earlier imperial portraits. Constantine gazes into the far distance with his eyes lifted as if to heaven. The symbolism is clear and sets the stage for the iconography of the early Christian and Byzantine world, where the emperor was seen as God's regent on earth.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/eust/hod_26.229.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/eust/hod_26.229.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: constantine,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lateantique,ElissaSCA: marble,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture"
