(266.7 x 525.8 cm);George A. Hearn Fund, 1957 (57.92);;Pollock had created his first &quot;drip&quot; painting in 1947, the product of a radical new approach to paint handling. With Autumn Rhythm, made in October of 1950, the artist is at the height of his powers. In this nonrepresentational picture, thinned paint was applied to unprimed, unstretched canvas that lay flat on the floor rather than propped on an easel. Poured, dripped, dribbled, scumbled, flicked, and splattered, the pigment was applied in the most unorthodox means. The artist also used sticks, trowels, knivesin short, anything but the traditional painter's implementsto build up dense, lyrical compositions comprised of intricate skeins of line. There's no central point of focus, no hierarchy of elements in this allover composition in which every bit of the surface is equally significant. The artist worked with the canvas flat on the floor, constantly moving all around it while applying the paint and working from all four sides.;;Size is significant: Autumn Rhythm is 207 inches wide. It assumes the scale of an environment, enveloping both for the artist as he created it and for viewers who confront it. The work is a record of its process of coming-into-being. Its dynamic visual rhythms and sensationsbuoyant, heavy, graceful, arcing, swirling, pooling lines of colorare direct evidence of the very physical choreography of applying the paint with the artist's new methods. Spontaneity was a critical element. But lack of premeditation should not be confused with ceding control; as Pollock stated, &quot;I can control the flow of paint: there is no accident.&quot;;;For Pollock, as for the Abstract Expressionists in general, art had to convey significant or revelatory content. He had arrived at abstraction having studied with Thomas Hart Benton, worked briefly with the Mexican muralists, confronted the methods and philosophy of the Surrealists, and immersed himself in a study of myth, archetype, and ancient and &quot;primitive&quot; art. And the divide between abstraction and figuration was more nuancedthere was a back-and-forth at various moments in his career. Toward the end of his life (he died in a car accident in 1956), he said, &quot;I'm very representational some of the time, and a little all of the time. But when you're working out of your unconscious, figures are bound to emerge. ... Painting is a state of being. ... Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is.&quot;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/na/ho_57.92.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/na/ho_57.92.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: jacksonpollock,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: abstractexpressionism,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2938850024.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2957071180.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2976556766.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2976556770.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2976556772.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2976556784.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2995258463.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2995258465.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 36","2995605058.jpg","53.24.3","The Cathedrals of Fifth Avenue by Florine Stettheimer in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","The Cathedrals of Fifth Avenue, 193132;Florine Stettheimer (American, 18711944);Oil on canvas; 60 1/8 x 50 1/8 in.

In portraiture, however, Girodet remained true to the precepts that he had learned in David's studio. This work, one of the artist's last portraits, betrays the meticulous technique characteristic of David's Neoclassicism, as well as Girodet's fascination with the perfected forms of Florentine Renaissance painting.;;Letters exchanged by Girodet and Mme Reizet indicate that artist and patron knew each other well and that every detail of the picture was discussed.

Years after Corot exhibited the painting at the Paris Salon of 1844, he cut it down substantially, reducing the sky and the landscape at right. He repainted the foreground in a darker palette and exhibited the revised canvas at the 1857 Salon. By then his stature ensured a better reception from the critics.

The silver plate (1994.402) from the Sasanian period illustrates the earliest known depiction of the tale dating to some six centuries before the written account by Firdausi. The ceramic bowls (57.36.2, .13) and the tile (10.56.2) provide examples of how the visual imagery of the tale was also carried into later Islamic periods when rulers were known to revere the earlier Sasanian kings.;;Plate with a Hunting Scene from the Tale of Bahram Gur and Azadeh;Gilded Silver;Iran ;Sasanian period, 5th century AD;;Accession # 1994.402;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: sasanian,ElissaSCA: plate,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: silver,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 36","3091860019.jpg","-","-","Charles Tilford","Arms and Armor Court.

(218.4 x 201.9 x 80.6 cm);Sansbury-Mills Fund, 1971 (1971.219);;Description;This rosewood etagere is a superb example of the Rococo Revival style, known variously during the mid-nineteenth century as &quot;modern French&quot; (because at the time it was the latest style), &quot;French antique,&quot; &quot;Louis Quatorze,&quot; and &quot;Louis Quinze.&quot; The latter two descriptions refer to French eighteen-century furniture styles popular during the reigns of Louis XIV (16431715) and Louis XV (17151774). Referencing eighteenth-century French sources, furniture in the Rococo Revival style is characterized by curved, cabriole legs, strong C- and S-curves and scrolls, and the extravagant use of carved, naturalistic ornament, particularly flowers. In keeping with the mid-nineteenth-century belief that certain styles were appropriate for specific rooms in the home, the Rococo Revival style was popular for the decoration of formal parlors, or reception rooms, and this etagere, combined with a parlor suite of seating furniture and a fine center table, would have inhabited a luxurious interior.; ;Synonymous with the colloquial term &quot;whatnot,&quot; etagere is a French word describing an arrangement of shelves, often with a mirrored back, used in nineteenth-century homes for the display of small decorative objects. Labeled by the New York cabinetmaker Alexander Roux, this etagere has been dated between 1850 and 1857 on the basis of the business address on the paper label affixed to the back. Related console tables, similar to the lower half of this piece, are owned by the Museum of the City of New York and the Thomas Gibbons house in Madison, New Jersey (now a part of Drew University).;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a

Sostratos is presented as an athlete. In his right hand, he holds a strigil, the metal scraper used to cleanse the skin after it had been rubbed with oil. The slave boy beside him holds an aryballos (oil flask) and carries a garment over his left shoulder. The youth's hand touching his head suggests that he may be crowning himself after a victory. The placement of the fingers offers the alternative that the gesture is one of mourning.

(95.2 cm);Bequest of Mary Clark Thompson, 1923 (26.229);;Constantine was the first Christian emperor of Rome, and his reign had a profound effect on the subsequent development of the Roman, and later Byzantine, world. Constantine's reign marked a distinct shift away from the administrative system set up by the emperor Diocletian in 293 A.D., which saw the division of the empire into four territories each governed by one of four imperial partners. This Tetrarchy was founded on the idea of homogeneous authority; all four emperors were depicted together in portraits emphasizing their unity and indivisibility in order to bolster their strength and present the image of a unified empire. Although Diocletian's intent had been to permanently do away with dynastic succession, Constantine's aim was to establish a new dynasty and to found a new capital, named Constantinople after himself. He also succeeded in reunifying the empire with the defeat of the last of his former tetrarchic colleagues, the Eastern emperor Licinius.;Although the court and administration no longer resided at Rome, Constantine was careful not to neglect the old imperial city and adorned it with many new secular and Christian buildings. The most famous of these is the triumphal arch, the Arch of Constantine, which still stands near the Colosseum. This work contains reused material from earlier monuments, a practice that was not only economical but probably also intended to shed reflected glory on the emperor by associating his reign in a very direct and practical way with that of famous &quot;good&quot; emperors from the past. This desire to link himself to his revered predecessors greatly influenced Constantine's official portraiture, and contributed to the revival of certain classicizing features that had been absent from imperial portraiture for over a century.;The full breadth of Constantine's portraiture demonstrates a remarkable evolution: early coin portraits show him in the manner of the Tetrarchs with a stubble beard and blocky physique, while later portraits such as this one, made after his assumption of sole power, show a significant change. In an effort to disassociate himself from his immediate predecessors, Constantine adopted an official image that recalled the calm, youthful faces of Augustus and Trajan. This colossal portrait head once surmounted an enormous statue of the seated emperor, and displays many features characteristic of Augustan and Trajanic portraiture. Most notably, Constantine is clean-shaven and his cap of hair is thick and arranged in comma-shaped locks across his forehead (compare this with the portrait head of Augustus (07.286.115). As part of his plan to reorganize the empire, Constantine's portraiture offered a new iconography to match his new regime.;This monumental head, as in smaller portraits and coins of Constantine, presents the emperor as detached from the real world. It lacks the intimacy and individual expressiveness of earlier imperial portraits.

(118 cm);Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace, Laura and James J. Ross, Daniel and Marian Malcolm, Robert T. Wall, Jeffrey B. Soref, Sidney and Bernice Clyman, and Steven M. Kossak Gifts, 2008 (2008.30);;The author of this Kongo personification of poweramong the most impressive sculptural creations from sub-Saharan Africasought to inspire awe, to intimidate, and to evoke a power without bounds. Conceived to house specific mystical forces, Kongo power figures were the collaborative creations of sculptors and ritual specialists. This work belongs to the most ambitious class of that tradition. It is one of only twenty such figures more than a meter high identified with the preeminent force of jurisprudence, Mangaaka.;This striking sculpture is an nkisi (pl. minkisi) from the Democratic Republic of Congo. An nkisi is essentially a container of spiritual forces that are directed to investigate the underlying cause of some chronic problem. As spiritual experts, banganga are approached by clients to address any of a multitude of crises that may emerge in the community, including illness, political instability, and social strife. Minkisi are essential to the nganga's profession, creating a focal point from which to draw upon the spirit realm and its powers. Just as minkisi are directed toward specific ends, the banganga that own and control them may be specialized to address specific issues. For instance, only experienced banganga assume the responsibility of the most powerful minkisi, those concerned with political matters and the administration of justice.;After a sculptor carves the figure at the core of the nkisi, it is the responsibility of the nganga to customize it by adding symbolic materials. Consequently, each nkisi is a unique creation, and can be controlled only by the nganga that conceived of its arrangement. The nganga begins by packing various &quot;medicines&quot; into a central abdominal cavity. The diverse ingredients of the medicines may include special earths and stones, leaves and seeds, parts of animals, bird beaks and feathers, and are specifically combined to attract and direct forces to the desired goal. The figure's belly, or mooyowhich, not coincidentally, also translates as &quot;life&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;is another spiritual focal point, packed with medicines and then sealed with resin.;As the figure is used and reused, the addition of materials enhances its ability to direct forces while simultaneously augmenting its visual intricacy. As illustrated in this example, nails, bits of cloth, beads, bells, even miniature carvings have all been added to literally and figuratively load the figure with spiritual power. Many of the objects are tied to a cloth collar around the neck, a feature not commonly found on other minkisi. While prevalent teeth and wide, aggressive eyes characterize many other minkisi, this example is further distinguished by the serenity of its facial expression, a sharp contrast to the rusted nails and complex assemblage of accoutrements that ornament the body of the figure below.;The kingdom of Kongo was at the height of its power in 1482, when Portuguese sailors first visited the coast of Central Africa. Founded between 1350 and 1400, the kingdom was a model of centralized government, with a divine king and a network of advisers, provincial governors, and village chiefs who ruled as many as three million people.

(209.6 cm);Gift of Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, 1989 (1989.407);;The Burghers of Calais, commemorating an episode during the Hundred Years' War between England and France, is probably the best and certainly the most successful of Rodin's public monuments. Rodin closely followed the account of the French chronicler Jean Froissart (1333 or 1337after 1400) stating that six of the principal citizens of Calais were ordered to come out of their besieged city with head and feet bare, ropes around their necks, and the keys of the town and the caste in their hands. They were brought before the English king Edward III (13121377), who ordered their beheading. Rodin has portrayed them at the moment of departure from their city led by Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the bearded man in the middle of the group. At his side, Jean d'Aire carres a giant-sized key. Their oversized feet are bare, many have ropes around their necks, and all are in various states of despair, expecting imminent death and unaware that their lives will ultimately be saved by the intercession of the English queen Philippa. The arrangement of the group, with its unorthodox massing and subtle internal rhythms, was not easily settled, and the completed monument, cast in bronze by the Le Blanc-Barbedienne foundry, was not unveiled in Calais until 1895. The Metropolitan Museum's bronze is a lost-wax casting made from the plaster model in the Musee Rodin in Paris.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,Stylized,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","3175133915.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,Stylized,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","3175140523.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,Stylized,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","3177760690.jpg","-","LNYCart606","qpkarl","God does his thing.

(16.3 cm);Purchase, Joseph Pulitzer Bequest, 1966 (66.173);;Soon after the political transformations of the Uruk period in southern Mesopotamia, similar innovationsincluding writing and cylinder seals, the mass production of standardized ceramics, and a figural art styledeveloped around the city of Susa in southwestern Iran, an area in which the predominant language was Elamite. While most of these innovations were adapted from Mesopotamian examples, they took on distinctive Elamite characteristics in Iran.;;This small silver bull, clothed in a garment decorated with a stepped pattern and holding a spouted vessel, shows a curious blend of human and animal traits. The large neck meets distinctly human shoulders, which taper into arms that end in hooves. Representations of animals in human postures were common in Proto-Elamite art, possibly as symbols of natural forces but just as likely as protagonists in myths or fables. The function of this small masterpiece remains uncertain. Traces of cloth found affixed to the figure suggest that it was intentionally buried, perhaps as part of a ritual or ceremony.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/02/wai/ho_66.173.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/02/wai/ho_66.173.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: silver,ElissaSCA: bull,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","2754114982.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","2783754845.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","3469882276.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 36","3472625783.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture"
