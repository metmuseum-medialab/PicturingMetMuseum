(70.5 x 104.1 cm);Bequest of Sam A. Lewisohn, 1951 (51.112.6);;This painting is Seurat's final sketch for his masterpiece, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte (Art Institute of Chicago). The much larger, finished version was shown in the eighth Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Seurat analyzed the elements of his composition with nearly scientific care in at least thirty-two preparatory drawings and paintings. The scene depicted is an island in the Seine where working-class Parisians strolled, relaxed, and fished on Sundays. In a letter of 1890, Seurat states that he began work on the final canvas about August 15, 1884. In October 1885, he met Camille Pissarro and, following his advice, repainted the canvas using pigments that by 1892 had begun to lose their brilliance. The present study provides, therefore, a record of the chromatic intensity which the artist intended to achieve in the full-scale painting. As in the final work, the sketch juxtaposes contrasting pigments and depends on optical mixturethe phenomenon that causes two tones seen at a distance to form a single hueto create the desired effect. Seurat based his knowledge of the science of color on the technical treatises of M. E. Chevreul (Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colours, 1839) and Ogden N. Rood (Modern Chromatics, 1879).

In his pictures, one can chart the seasons, the weather, or as here, the look of women's fashion in 1873. Monet's wife, Camille Doncieux, is as easily recognizable as the mounds of geraniums in the garden of the couple's rented house in Argenteuil.;;Camille Monet on a Garden Bench is the most enigmatic of Monet's rare genre pictures. Numerous interpretations have been offered, yet nothing has been found in the literature or theater of Monet's time that corresponds to this scene. The most telling clue may be biographical: the death of Camille's father in September 1873. Camille was an impassive model, but here she telegraphs sadness, while holding a note in her gloved hand.

The author, traditionally believed to be Matthew the Evangelist, reports that King Herod ordered the execution of all young male children in the village of Bethlehem, so as to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the Magi. Like much of Matthew's gospel, the incident is introduced as the fulfillment of passages in the Old Testament read as prophecies:;; Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children.[1];;The infants, known in the Church as the Holy Innocents, have been claimed as the first Christian martyrs. Traditional accounts number them at more than ten thousand, though more conservative estimates put their number in the low dozens.;;The incident is not mentioned by the contemporary Jewish historian Josephus, nor in the other gospels, nor in the early Biblical apocrypha, its first appearance in any source other than Matthew being the 2nd century Protoevangelium of James 22.[2] Most recent biographers of Herod therefore do not regard the massacre as an actual historical event,[3] but rather, like the other nativity stories, as creative hagiography.[4] Herod the Great (73 BCE 4 BCE) was an Idumean (or Edomite) whom the Romans established as the king of Idumea, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. He was ruthless in defense of his power and notorious for his brutality.</i>;;This painting makes me sad. :(","Maulleigh: massacre,Maulleigh: innocents,Maulleigh: sano,Maulleigh: di,Maulleigh: pietro,Maulleigh: ansano,Maulleigh: mencio,Maulleigh: met,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: painting,Maulleigh: art,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 37","3412470789.jpg","-","Madonna and Child, ca 1510","Maulleigh","Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) (Italian, Venetian, born about 1488, died 1576);;Dating from around 1510, this is among the earliest devotional paintings of the Madonna and Child by Titian.

But the friendship was broken in January 1793 when Gerard denounced Gros for contemplating emigration, an accusation that could result in trial for treason. Gros probably made this sensitive and delicate portrait in Paris before Gerard departed for study in Rome in 1790; Gerard reciprocated with a handsome portrait of Gros in the wide-brimmed hat favored by revolutionaries (Musee des Augustins, Toulouse).

He returned to this harbor city in Normandy, twice in 1896 and in 1898, for three extended painting campaigns in the wake of Monet's &quot;Rouen Cathedral&quot; series of the early 1890s, which Pissarro greatly admired. By the time of his last sojourn, from July to October 1898, he was &quot;already familiar with the motifs there.&quot; However, Pissarro tackled many of the same cityscapes again and was inspired to find some scenes that were new. On August 19, Pissarro wrote to his son Lucien: &quot;Yesterday I found an excellent place from which I can paint the rue de l'Epicerie and even the market [in the place de la Haute-Vieille-Tour], a really interesting one, which takes place every Friday.&quot; Ultimately, he painted the view three times, but the Metropolitan's picture is the only one that shows the market in progress.","Maulleigh: camille,Maulleigh: pissarro,Maulleigh: sunlight,Maulleigh: rouen,Maulleigh: normandy,Maulleigh: cathedral,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: met,Maulleigh: painting,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 37","3395986810.jpg","-","Women Picking Olives","Maulleigh","Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 18531890);;Title;Women Picking Olives;;Date;188990;;Medium;Oil on canvas;;Dimensions;28 5/8 x 36 in.

This oil sketch is the fifth of six paintings of the cathedral seen from the south that Constable produced between 1820 and 1826. His first, finished version of this composition was commissioned by Dr. John Fisher, bishop of Salisbury. Fisher's nephew, the archdeacon, ranked among the artist's closest friends and supporters. The initial sketch in this series presented the 400-foot spire framed by towering trees and surmounted by a dark storm cloud. Although the bishop admired Constable's rendering, he requested a modified version featuring a brighter sky.;;Constable created the Museum's painting (a full-scale preparatory sketch for a finished work that is now in the Frick Collection, New York) with the bishop in mind.

Hess, 1984 (1984.613.2);;Willem de Kooning, born in Rotterdam in 1904, was apprenticed to a commercial arts and decorating firm there from 1916 to 1921. From 1917 to 1921 he also studied at the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts and Techniques. In 1926 he left Holland illegally for the United States by working in the engine room of a ship and, newly arrived in New Jersey, supported himself as a house painter. De Kooning moved to New York City in 1927, and within a few years he was friends with the artists John Graham, Stuart Davis, David Smith, Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, and Mark Rothko. From the late 1930s through the 1950s his biomorphic abstractions (which allude to figures and landscapes) and his series Women placed him in the center of the Abstract Expressionist art movement. The gestural style of painting and the visual vocabulary of forms that he developed at this time continued to inform his later work. De Kooning was an accomplished draftsman as well as painter and made his first sculptures in 1969.; ;&quot;Woman&quot; belongs to his first series of women, begun about 1940. Like other works in this series, the colors are raucously bright jarring hues of green, ocher, blue, and orange and the imagery is tenuously balanced between realism and abstraction. An awkwardly posed, somewhat grotesquely formed female figure is broadly painted without modeling. The parts of her body are reduced to independent abstract shapes and lines, as is the spatially flattened environment in which she exists. Her comical, masklike face, with smiling bow-shaped lips and large bulging eyes, adds to the light air of the picture. Although de Kooning's image is recognizable as a woman, the emphasis is on the abstract arrangement of form, line, and color.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern_art/woman/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=210004085&amp;collID=21&amp;vw=0>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: abstractexpressionism,ElissaSCA: dekooning,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 37","2938044587.jpg","1980.420","Stepping Out by Roy Lichtenstein in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Roy Lichtenstein (American, 19231997);;Stepping Out, 1978;;Oil and magna on canvas; 86 x 70 in.

The male is based on a figure in Fernand Leger's painting &quot;Three Musicians&quot; of 1944 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), but seen in mirror image. He wears a straw hat, high-collared shirt, and striped tie; the flower in his lapel is borrowed from another Leger painting. The female figure, with her dramatically reduced and displaced features, resembles the Surrealistic women depicted by Picasso during the 1930s.

Like other Futurists, his work centered on the portrayal of movement (dynamism), speed, and technology. He was born in Reggio Calabria, Italy.;;Umberto Boccioni studied art through the Scuola Libera del Nudo at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, beginning in 1901. He also studied design with a sign painter in Rome. Together with his friend Gino Severini, he became a student of Giacomo Balla, a divisionist painter. In 1906, Boccioni studied Impressionist and Post-Impressionist styles in Paris. During later 1906 and early 1907, he shortly took drawing classes at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. In 1901, Boccioni first visited the Famiglia Artistica, a society for artists in Milan. After moving there in 1907, he became acquainted with fellow Futurists including the famous poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. The two would later join with others in writing manifestos on futurism.;;Boccioni became the main theorist of the artistic movement. He also decided to be a sculptor after he visited various studios in Paris, in 1912, among which those of Braque, Archipenko, Brancusi, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and, probably, Medardo Rosso. While in 1912 he exhibited some paintings together with other Italian futurists at the Bernheim-Jeun, in 1913 he returned to show his sculptures at the Gallerie La Boetie: all related to the elaboration of what Boccioni had seen in Paris, they in their turn probably influenced the cubist sculptors, especially Duchamp-Villon.</i>","Maulleigh: selfportrait,Maulleigh: umberto,Maulleigh: boccioni,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 37","1483860733.jpg","90.5.848","Textile Square with the Head of Spring  in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Square with the Head of Spring;Multicolored wools, tapestry weave;Byzantine, said to be from Panopolis (now Akhmim, Egypt);Woven 300-500 AD;;Accession # 90.5.848;;Personifications of the seasons were thought to represent prosperity.

To the right of the striding goddess is an inscription: &quot;one of the prizes from Athens.&quot;;;On the basis of stylistic criteria, this vase has been attributed to the Kleophrades Painter, one of the preeminent painters of Attic black-figure vases. After the mid-sixth century B.C., artists' signatures do not appear on Panathenaic amphorae, rather it seems that certain artists used their own &quot;trademark&quot; shield devices. The Kleophrades Painter favored Pegasus, the winged horse, as is depicted here on the shield of the striding Athena.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/ho_07.286.79.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/ho_07.286.79.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: amphora,ElissaSCA: athena,ElissaSCA: goddess,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: blackfigure,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 37","3081885589.jpg","-","Knights in Shining Armor III","IslesPunkFan","Taken at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.","IslesPunkFan: armour,IslesPunkFan: armor,IslesPunkFan: knights,IslesPunkFan: medieval,IslesPunkFan: middleages,IslesPunkFan: europe,IslesPunkFan: metal,IslesPunkFan: newyork,IslesPunkFan: metropolitanmuseumofart,IslesPunkFan: metropolitanmuseum,Description,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 37","3089397329.jpg","20.3.8","Procession Bringing Offerings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2008","ElissaSCA","Procession Bringing Offerings (M);Dynasty 12, early reign of Amenemhat I, (ca. 1981-1975 BC);Painted wood;Model chamber, Tomb of Meketre, (MMA 1101), western Thebes;;Accession # 20.3.8;;Two men and two women, possibly Meketre's sons and daughters, walk in step on a narrow base.

(17.15 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1931 (31.11.10);;On this small lekythos (oil flask), the Amasis Painter has depicted a scene of women engaged in various stages of wool working. In the center of the vessel, two women work an upright loom. Weights tied to the ends of the warp threads hold them taut. The woman on the left pushes the weft thread, while her companion separates the warp threads with a headle rod. The finished portion of the woven material is rolled up at the top of the loom. To the right of the loom, three women perform the first step, which consists of weighing the wool taken from a basket; a third woman supervises the operation. Farther to the right, four women spin wool into yarn, while two others fold the finished cloth on a low stool.;;The making of textiles was one of the most important occupations for women in ancient Greece. A woman would manufacture the clothing worn by every member of her family, as well as other household textiles. Fine weaving skills were testimony to a woman's industriousness and value. A good weaver was considered an attractive woman, as well as a good wife. Homer describes Penelope, the devoted wife of Odysseus, busy at her loom day after day. This lekythos seems to link weaving with marriage. Just above the loom on the shoulder of the vessel, there is a seated woman holding out her veil in a gesture associated with brides in Greek art.;;Such scenes probably render quite accurately the activities of women and men, maidens and youths, in Athens during the sixth century B.C., and the Amasis Painter was one of the foremost black-figure artists active during that time. This lekythos displays the characteristic features of his artthe relatively small scale of the figures, the meticulous precision of the drawing, and the keen observation of details.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/evdy/hod_31.11.10.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/evdy/hod_31.11.10.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: amasispainter,ElissaSCA: lekythos,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 37","1008594073.jpg","11.55","Marble Statue of Herakles Seated on a Rock in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,  July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble statue of Herakles seated on a rock;Roman, Imperial period, 1st or 2nd century AD;Adaptation of a Greek statue of the late 4th or early 3rd century BC;;Accession # 11.55;;The great hero was shown resting on a rock with his legs stretched out in front of him, his club braced under his left armpit.

The firstthe Akkadian Empire (23502150 B.C.) was centered at Agade, a city still not located by archaeologists but probably near modern Baghdad. The official language of this empire was Akkadian, a Semitic language that differed greatly from Sumerian, which previously had been the predominant language of Mesopotamia. In addition to its political and economic innovations in administering a large territory, the Akkadian court produced innovative art in a powerful and naturalistic style.;This magnificent head portrays a king of the late third millennium B.C. Its heavy-lidded eyes, prominent but unexaggerated nose, full lips, and enlarged ears all suggest a portrait of an actual person. While the date and place of manufacture of this piece have been much debated, its close similarity to the magnificent bronze head found at Nineveh make a late third millennium date most likely. The head is cast almost solid (making it extremely heavy), but a dowel hole at the base would have served to join it to a body or other support, most likely for display in a temple setting. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=47.100.80 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;view...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: akkadian,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: green,ElissaSCA: copper,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","1056688029.jpg","59.2","Seated Statue of Gudea in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Seated statue of Gudea, 21502100 B.C.; Neo-Sumerian period;Probably Tello (ancient Girsu), southern Mesopotamia;Diorite; H. 17 3/8 in.

Ivory, prized throughout the ancient world, was used extensively at the time of the Assyrian Empire (ca. 883612 B.C.). The material was valued by craftsmen because it could be carved in such detail. Although modern tastes appreciate the beauty of an ivory surface, these carvings were often covered with gold foil. Many of the ivories found at Nimrud were brought as booty or tribute from the vassal states to the west of Assyria, where elephants were native and ivory carving was a long-established craft. Others were undoubtedly carved in Assyria by craftsmen brought as captives to the capital cities. Contemporary inscriptions record that Ashurnasirpal took &quot;couches of ivory overlaid with gold&quot; from a city on the western Tigris and received tribute of &quot;elephant tusks and ivory thrones overlaid with gold and silver.&quot; Thousands of ivory fragments were discovered by the British in their excavations of the ruins of Nimrud. Stripped of their gold covering by invading armies, the ivories themselves were discarded as being of little worth.;;Syrian-style ivories have been found in Syriaparticularly at the site of Arslan Tashas well as in the Assyrian palaces of northern Mesopotamia. Works in this style include both flat panels used for furniture decoration and such three-dimensional objects as circular boxes and small figures. Syrian-style ivory carving is distinguished by the stocky proportions of the figures, oval faces with small mouths and large eyes, plants with a long wavy stem, and a winged sun disc with pendant volute curls. Unlike the symmetrical compositions of Phoenician ivories, Syrian examples often depict a single figure in profile that completely fills the surface of the plaque. Nude female figures wearing elaborately curled tresses and diadems, sculpted in the round either singly or in groups, are a particularly striking theme. Syrian-style ivories were made primarily during the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.;;This ivory carving would have been one of a group of similar panels used in the back of a chair. It depicts a bearded man, perhaps a warrior, holding the stem of a lotus plant. Above him, a winged disc provides protection. ;;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label and ;<a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=59.107.6>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;view...</a>;;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: assyrian,ElissaSCA: ivory,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: furniture,ElissaSCA: inlay,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","1547550513.jpg","39.158.1","Detail of a Wooden Panel with Winged Figures in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Wooden Panel with Winged Figures;Painted in encaustic;Byzantine;Painted 400-500, in Egypt;;Accession # 39.158.1;;The pair of naturalistically rendered winged figures, possibly angels, are rendered in encaustic, or melted colored wax, the medium used for the earliest surviving icons.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: lateantique,ElissaSCA: icon,ElissaSCA: panel,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: wood,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: egypt,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","1557354463.jpg","65.29.3","Buddhist Stela: Maitreya Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Buddhist Stela: Maitreya Buddha;Northern Wei dynasty (386-534), dated 489-95;Shanxi province ;Stone;;Accession # 65.29.3;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","1563983804.jpg","-","Shiva, Uma & Their Son Skanda in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Shiva, Uma, and their Son Skanda (Somaskandamurti);India (Tamil Nadu), Chola period, early 11th century;Copper alloy;;Text excerpted from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: indian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: copper,ElissaSCA: god,ElissaSCA: goddess,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","1601224083.jpg","L 1993.88.2","Dancing Celestial in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Dancing Celestial;India (Uttar Pradesh).;Early 12th century.;Sandstone.;H. 331/2 in.

(96.5 x 68.6 cm);Rogers Fund, 1919 (19.186);;Buddhist images executed in dry lacquer were highly valued by the Chinese because of their costly and time-consuming process of production. There are so few surviving examples that this seated Buddha is especially precious. To fashion the body of the image, the craftsman made a rough form of the sculpture in clay and then applied at least three layers of hemp cloth, each secured with a paste made of raw lacquer (the sap from the lac tree, Rhus verniciflua) and a fine powder of bone, horn, shell, ceramic, stone, or carbon. Each layer had to dry thoroughly before the next could be added. The clay core was then removed from the lacquered image. The head and hands were likely modeled separately, using the same technique as that used for the body, and then attached to the sculpture. The surface was finished with several coatings of pure lacquer and then painted.;;Portrayed as a youthful figure, the Buddha sits in the full lotus position, with his legs tightly interlocked, though the lower part of the sculpture is missing. The position of the damaged arms suggests that the hands performed the gesture of contemplation. The columnar form and lean gracefulness of the figure recall the style of Buddhist sculpture of the late Period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386589), but the attempt to render anatomical differentiation and, in particular, the emotional impact of the Buddha's expression are distinguishing features of early Tang style. The traces of brilliant red and blue, vividly combined to form a stylized floral pattern in the hem of the undergarment crossing the chest, and the remains of shimmering gilt on the surface are evidence of the sumptuous effect of this once colorful figure.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","1675839500.jpg","16.32.194","Virgin & Child from Auvergne in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Virgin and Child in Majesty, 11501200;French; Made in Auvergne;Oak, polychromy, gesso, linen; H. 31 in.

The surface is richly contoured and decorated, and the concern for finish extends to the background, which is enlivened by the heads and feathery wings of seraphim.

In Chinese archaeological writings, this type of figure is called a zhenmushou and at times identified as a spirit that has the power to keep the spirit of the dead from roaming. Popular from the sixth through the eight century, zhenmushou figures are often found in pairs at the entrance to a tomb. The origin of these figures is unclear. Some scholars speculate that they evolved from dog or doglike figures found in some later Han-dynasty tombs. Others trace their roots to three-horned, four-legged creatures produced during the Western Jin dynasty (265317 A.D.).;;This animated figure is typical of the stylistic innovation that made its debut in Northern Weidynasty tomb sculpture. The lines are elegant, its modeling well articulated and powerful. Each of its parts is sharply defined, yet one is aware of the entire figure and its innate sense of pent-up energy.

Clutching her staff and cupping hand to ear, she strains for sounds of Glaucus (a nobleman with whom she has fallen desperately in love) and his fiancee Ione. Accustomed to darkness, blind Nydia uses her acute hearing to find the two, leading them to safety at the shore; but in the end, despairing of the impossibility of her love, she drowns herself. ;;In the second half of the nineteenth century, the public was fascinated with such stories of Pompeii's destruction. Rogers (who lived in Italy and based this work on the classical Greek sculpture he studied in museums there) made a small fortune on the more than fifty marble copies of Nydia that were commissioned by admirers and carved by highly skilled Italian craftsmen after the artist's model.;;Praised for both his technical skill and sensitive interpretation of the subject, Rogers devised a variety of surfaces for the life-size Nydia -- the girl's face, arms, and breast are smoothed with a soulful translucence while the billowing skirt is cut into thin, dynamic folds. The movement of the drapery, as it wraps Nydia's staff and streams against her body to reveal her young figure, gave the sculpture a dynamism and sensuality that resonated with Victorian viewers. All this, with the detailed tooling of the fallen Corinthian capital, symbol of the volcano's destruction, demonstrated the virtuosity of the conception and carving. ;;Text (apart from the first paragraph) Copyright 2006 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. ;;Text (apart from the first paragraph taken from): <a href=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sculpture/noflash/zone5-2.htm>www.nga.gov/collection/sculpture/noflash/zone5-2.htm</a>;","ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: uppereastside,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: city,ElissaSCA: 2006,ElissaSCA: blind,ElissaSCA: girl,ElissaSCA: pompeii,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: usa,ElissaSCA: film,ElissaSCA: canon,ElissaSCA: rebelg,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,ElissaSCA: neoclassicism,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","2994879711.jpg","53.87a-i","Kouros by Isamu Noguchi in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Kouros, 194445;Isamu Noguchi (American, 19041988);Marble; H. 117 in. (297.2 cm), base: D. 34 1/8 in. (86.7 cm), W. 42 in. (106.7 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1953 (53.87a-i);;Born in America in 1904 to a Japanese father and an American mother, Isamu Noguchi spent most of his childhood in Japan (190618) before returning to the United States to continue his schooling (191824). Between 1927 and 1937, his frequent and extended travels to Europe, China, Japan, and Mexico, where he saw modern painting and sculpture being made, studied calligraphy, and painted a mural, provided him with an eclectic range of artistic experiences upon which to draw.;;Noguchi's sculptures and drawings from the mid-1940s are occupied with figurative and biomorphic imagery. Kouros illustrates the biomorphic vocabulary that Noguchi devised in order to abstract the human figure into fragmented, bonelike elements, and may be compared to the biomorphic abstractions produced by such Surrealist artists as Jean Arp, Matta, Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, and Yves Tanguy. However, Noguchi always contended that the organic quality of his work came not from Surrealist examples but from his familiarity with traditional Japanese arts and craftsbells, samurai swords, and floral arrangements.;;Although Surrealism no doubt played a part in Noguchi's use of biomorphic abstraction in the 1940s, he was already predisposed to it by an earlier and more memorable experiencethat of working with the sculptor Constantin Brancusi in Paris while traveling on a Guggenheim Fellowship. As Brancusi's part-time studio assistant for about five months in 1927, the twenty-two-year-old Noguchi learned how simple organic shapes could evoke figurative associations. He also acquired the techniques needed to carve in stone, which he first used for his own sculpture in the 1930s and which continued to dominate his aesthetic for more than fifty years. This dedication to traditional techniques and materials was in direct opposition to the more industrial welded-metal construction that was popularized in the 1940s and '50s by such sculptors as Herbert Ferber, Theodore Roszak, and David Smith.;;In all, Noguchi completed about fifteen interlocking sculptures between 1945 and 1948, including the Metropolitan Museum's famous pink marble sculpture Kouros, which is more than nine feet high. These sculptures were assembled from individual pieces of carved stone, without benefit of adhesives or pinions, by notching and slotting the pieces together. As Noguchi explained: &quot;You have to consider the weight of the material, the forces that conspire to hold up the figureengineering problems, essentially. Everything I do has an element of engineering in itparticularly since I dislike gluing parts together or taking advantage of something that is not inherent in the material ... there are no adhesives of any kindonly the stones holding themselves together.&quot;;;The fragmented figures that were created, in both drawings and sculpture, reflect Noguchi's feelings about the precarious state of the world after World War II, which he characterized as &quot;the encroaching void.&quot; Such feelings were echoed in the statements made by some of the Abstract Expressionists at the time and in the primordial and mythic imagery they chose to depict. For Noguchi, as for many Abstract Expressionists, abstraction was a way to convey the intimate relationship between contemporary man and these ancient, universal sources.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/na/ho_53.87a-i.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/na/ho_53.87a-i.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: kouros,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","3027369142.jpg","2008.30","-","ElissaSCA","Mangaaka Power Figure (Nkisi N'Kondi), second half of 19th century;Democratic Republic of Congo or Angola, Chiloango River Region; Kongo;Wood, metal, resin, enamel; H. 46 7/16 in.

Based freely on the Apollo Belvedere, which had been carried off to Paris under Napoleon, it was bought by Pope Pius VII and placed upon the pedestal where the Apollo had formerly stood. In the Museum's version, Canova has refined the ornamental details and aimed for a more lyrical effect than in the Vatican Perseus, a stylistic streamlining characteristic of his artistic process. Medusa's head is based on that of the antique &quot;Rondanini Medusa.&quot;;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: sculpture,qpkarl: statue,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,Description,DescriptionInDesc,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,Stylized,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","3174069819.jpg","21.76","LNYCart481","qpkarl","At the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;Seated <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat rel=nofollow>luohan</a>, Liao dynasty (9071125), ca. 1000;Yixian, Hebei Province, China;Earthenware with three-color (sancai) glaze; H. 41 1/4 in. (104.8 cm);Frederick C. Hewitt Fund, 1921 (21.76);;Buddhist tradition tells of groups of 16, 18, or 500 luohans who were commanded by Buddha to await the coming of Maitreya, the Future Buddha. This promise of salvation held great appeal to Chinese Buddhists at the end of the ninth century, for they had just been through a period a great persecution, and a cult built around the luohans as guardians gained momentum at that time.;The Museum has two statues from a group of seated luohans purportedly found in a mountain cave near Yizhou, (now known as Yixian) in Hebei Province, and dating from this unsettled period. The polychromatic glaze covering the figures has strong parallels to the well-known sancai, or three-color, tradition found in earlier Tang-dynasty funerary figures. The high quality of the designs and the use of sophisticated techniques such as reinforcing rods have long led scholars to speculate that this example, and others from the set, may have been made at one of the imperial kilns, where large firing chambers and highly skilled craftsmen were available.;The discovery of a kiln in Longquanwu at Mentougou village (a western suburb of Beijing) in 1983 and the subsequent excavation in 1985 have provided much useful information regarding the &quot;Yixian Luohans&quot; as the group is often known. In addition to a considerable quantity of sancai ware, the site also yielded three half-lifesize Buddhist sculptures: a white ceramic Buddha with a painted robe, and two bodhisattvas covered in a sancai-type glaze. Parallels to sculptures produced during the Liao dynasty suggest that the works excavated at Longquanwu date to the second half of the tenth century, while the famous Luohans were made slightly later, probably during the early years of the reign of Shengzong (9821031).;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: unitedstates,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: sculpture,qpkarl: statue,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,Stylized,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 37","3176926475.jpg","-","LNYCart619","qpkarl","A bronze sconce.

(33.3 cm);Purchase, Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift, in honor of Cynthia Hazen and Leon B. Polsky, 1982 (1982.220.8);;Krishna, whose legend is told in Books Ten and Eleven of the great Hindu epic, the Bhagavata Purana, was threatened as a baby by the wicked tyrant Kamsa. To protect him, his parents, Vevaki and Vasudeva, hid him with a cowherd and his wife Yashoda. Krishna survived to become the hero of many well-loved stories, and is often represented as a young man or as a mischievous child.;;Depictions of Yashoda holding her foster son Krishna are rare, especially in sculptural form.
