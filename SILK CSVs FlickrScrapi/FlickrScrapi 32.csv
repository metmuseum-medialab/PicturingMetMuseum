(25.1 x 20 cm), Fletcher Fund, 1919 (19.73.1), , Under the influence of Italian theory, Durer became increasingly drawn to the idea that the perfect human form corresponded to a system of proportion and measurements. Near the end of his life, he wrote several books codifying his theories: the Underweysung der Messung (Manual of measurement), published in 1525, and Vier Bucher von menschlichen Proportion (Four books of human proportion), published in 1528, just after his death. Durer's fascination with ideal form is manifest in Adam and Eve. The first man and woman are shown in nearly symmetrical idealized poses: each with the weight on one leg, the other leg bent, and each with one arm angled slightly upward from the elbow and somewhat away from the body. The figure of Adam is reminiscent of the Hellenistic Apollo Belvedere, excavated in Italy late in the fifteenth century. The first engravings of the sculpture were not made until well after 1504, but Durer must have seen a drawing of it. Durer was a complete master of engraving by 1504: human and snake skin, animal fur, and tree bark and leaves are rendered distinctively. The branch Adam holds is of the mountain ash, the Tree of Life, while the fig, of which Eve has broken off a branch, is the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. Four of the animals represent the medieval idea of the four temperaments: the cat is choleric, the rabbit sanguine, the ox phlegmatic, and the elk melancholic. Before the Fall, these humors were held in check, controlled by the innocence of man; once Adam and Eve ate from the apple of knowledge, all four were activated, all innocence lost., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/euwc/ho_19.73.1.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/euwc/ho_19.73.1.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2009, ElissaSCA: durer, ElissaSCA: german, ElissaSCA: renaissance, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: engraving,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,2D,Art2or3,drawing,Artwork","Drawing""SET 32","4107015136.jpg","-","Duo of Degas","mcj4476","The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer with The Dance Class","'mcj4476: metropolitan, mcj4476: museum, mcj4476: art, mcj4476: edgar, mcj4476: degasballetdancersculpturepainting,','mcj4476: metropolitan, mcj4476: museum, mcj4476: art, mcj4476: ,3D,Art2or3,2D,Artwork,painting_and_sculpture","Sculpture""SET 32","2109945438.jpg","09.136.2","NYC - Metropolitan Musuem of Art - Scenes from the Story of the Argonauts","wallyg","<i>Scenes from the Story of the Argonauts</i>, cassone panel, Biagio di Antonio (Italian, Florentine, active 1446-1516), Tempera on wood, gilt ornaments; Overall 24 1/8 x 60 3/8 in.

In preparation, Peale traveled to the Princeton and Trenton battlefields in February of 1779 to make sketches for the background. The original portrait, the full-length version now in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (in Philadelphia), was a tremendous success and Peale completed numerous copies for royal palaces abroad, each time updating the general's military dress. This figure of George Washington was probably painted between June and August of 1780. In every other version, Washington is shown after the Battle of Princeton, but here he is depicted after the Battle of Trenton, the turning point of the war.

(76.8 x 64.1 cm), , This portrait of President Washington, called the Gibbs-Channing-Avery portrait, is one of eighteen similar works known as the Vaughan group. The first of this type, presumably painted from life and then copied in all the others, originally belonged to Samuel Vaughan, a London merchant living in Philadelphia and a close friend of Washington. This original portrait by Stuart, painted in 1795 according to Rembrandt Peale, was subsequently acquired by Joseph Harrison of Philadelphia. While in Harrison's collection, Rembrandt Peale copied it many times. The version now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, considered to be one of the earliest and best replicas, was sold to Stuart's close friend, Colonel George Gibbs, and subsequently descended in the Gibbs family., , Stuart's portraits of Washington are at once lifelike and iconic. This portrait was one of Stuart's first likenesses of the president and reveals the extent to which Washington was apotheosized even before his death in 1799. It is characterized by a looseness of flesh appropriate to his age. Yet Stuart also expertly modeled the skin tones with blue-gray shadows so that Washington's face seems marble-like. He appears authoritative and aristocratic, an impression further emphasized by the exaggerated eyebrows.

The section of landscape at the upper left, executed in the loose brushwork and silvery palette of Corot's late style, was repainted by the artist in 1874, one year before his death, at the request of the painting's new owner., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/ho_1975.1.162.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/ho_1975.1.162.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: painting, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: corot, ElissaSCA: 19thcentury, ElissaSCA: mythology, ElissaSCA: french, ElissaSCA: diana, ElissaSCA: artemis, ElissaSCA: goddess,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 32","2450616174.jpg","1975.1.96","Portrait of Ginevra d'Antoino Lupari in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2008","ElissaSCA","Italian (Emilian School), 15th century, Portrait of Ginevra d'Antonio Lupari (?), 1494, , From the Robert Lehman Collection, Accession # 1975.1.96, , Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: painting, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: portrait, ElissaSCA: italian, ElissaSCA: renaissance,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 32","2618675897.jpg","19.77.2","Detail of Madame Jacques-Louis Leblanc by Ingres in the Metropoltian Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Madame Jacques-Louis Leblanc (Francoise Poncelle, 17881839), 1823, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (French, 17801867), Oil on canvas; 47 x 36 1/2 in.

Schoenborn, 1994 (1994.486), , As a young man in France, Fernand Leger was apprenticed to an architect (189799), then worked as an architectural draftsman (190002) and a photographic retoucher (190304). He studied art at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs and the Academie Julian in Paris. Along with Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris, Leger ranks among the foremost Cubist painters of the teens. Even after the height of Cubism, his paintings continued to utilize pure color and to employ forms that had been simplified into the geometric components of the cone, cube, and sphere. After World War I, when Leger became friends with Le Corbusier and Amedee Ozenfant, who were leaders of the Purist movement in Paris (ca. 1918ca. 1925), his work exemplified the &quot;machine aesthetic.&quot;, , &quot;Woman with a Cat&quot; belongs to a group of monumental female figures some reading, others drinking cups of tea that are emblematic of the artist's new grand figure style from his &quot;mechanica&quot; period of 191823. These works might be seen as preparatory for his large masterpiece &quot;Three Women (Le Grand Dejeuner)&quot; of 1921 (Museum of Modern Art, New York) and its two smaller variants. Leger also painted variations of the single-figure composition and made a slightly smaller, nearly identical version of &quot;Woman with a Cat&quot; (Kunsthalle, Hamburg)., , Motionless, hierarchic, and frontal, this colossal creature seems made of some undefinable rubberized substance. The powerful large nude woman, painted in grisaille, is composed of spheres, cones, and tubes. She leans against billowing pillows one off-white, the other a black-and-yellow diamond pattern. A yellow blanket protects her lap, upon which rests an open book and a cat. Her mane of black hair covers half of her white spherical face. The stark simplicity of the composition is matched by the reduced palette of red, yellow, black, and white., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/Woman_with_a_Cat_Fernand_Leger/objectview.aspx?OID=210006638&amp;collID=21&amp;dd1=21>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/Woman_...</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: modern, ElissaSCA: painting, ElissaSCA: french, ElissaSCA: leger, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: abstract,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 32","2915925586.jpg","1999.363.36","Mechanical Elements by Leger in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Mechanical Elements, 1920, Fernand Leger (French, 18811955), Oil on canvas; 36 1/8 x 23 1/2 in. (91.8 x 59.7 cm), Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection, 1998 (1999.363.36), , Leger was one of the most prominent and prolific artists working in Paris in the first half of the twentieth century. He was first associated with the avant-garde in 1909, when he exhibited his work at the Salon d'Automne in the company of artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Constantin Brancusi. His early mature work was strongly influenced by Cubism and, after serving in World War I, he developed a personal style of abstraction that further manifested the speed and dynamism of contemporary society., , Leger's &quot;mechanical period,&quot; which lasted from about 1918 to 1923, reflects his infatuation with the machine and with modern technology. Works from this period are characterized by recurring interchangeable geometric elementsamong them, the cone, the cylinder, and the diskthat seem suspended in a completely flat or shallow, relieflike space. Actually, none of these works depicts identifiable mechanical parts, but, instead, each is meant to evoke the impersonality of a new machine age., , In this picture, we are confronted with a rather cheerful and decorative mechanized world of abstracted joints, pistons, and levers. Set against a framework of thick, black horizontal and vertical lines, Leger's &quot;mechanical elements&quot; are composed of tightly interlocking circles, ellipses, curves, diagonals, rectangles, dots, and groups of parallel wavy lines. In their syncopated arrangement, these brightly colored forms bring to mind the urban architecture, new modes of transportation, and time-saving technologies that were transforming the modern world., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geab/ho_1999.363.36.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geab/ho_1999.363.36.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: french, ElissaSCA: modern, ElissaSCA: abstract, ElissaSCA: painting, ElissaSCA: leger, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 32","2915925600.jpg","1999.363.37","Divers: Blue and Black by Leger in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Fernand Leger.

The War Motifs, his German military series, are intensely powerful canvases in an Expressionist vein; they reflect not only his revulsion at the wartime destruction, but also his fascination with the energy and pageantry that accompanied the carnage. Portrait of a German Officer, painted in November 1914, shows Hartley's assimilation of both Cubism (the collage-like juxtaposition of visual fragments and the hieratic structuring of geometric shapes) and German Expressionism (the coarse brushwork and the dramatic color). The condensed mass of images (badges, flags, medals) evokes a collective psychological and physical portrait of the officer.

(159.39 x 118.75 cm), Rogers Fund, 1920 (20.192.16), , This fresco from the Imperial villa at Boscotrecase depicts two consecutive events from the myth of Perseus and Andromeda. Perseus is about to rescue Andromeda from the ketos, a snaky sea monster painted in a brilliant blue-green palette. The creature raises his head with gigantic open jaws and frightful teeth toward Andromeda, who stands with outstretched arms in the center of the panel. One hand appears to be chained to the crag; the other elegantly placed on the rocks. Perseus flies in from the left with his lyre in one hand, winged shoes on his feet, and a windblown cloak over his shoulder. In the upper right portion of the fresco, he is greeted by Andromeda's grateful father, a scene that alludes to the myth's happy endingthe marriage of hero and princess., , The fortunes of love and the ever-present sea are the themes that link this fresco and that of Polyphemus and Galatea (20.192.17) from the same cubiculum at Boscotrecase.

The room and all of its contents were conceived as a unified whole and were created in 1910-14 under the artistic supervision of Rateau's friend Lucien Levy-Dhurmer (1865-1953), who was also responsible for a number of other rooms in the apartment, including two salons, a library, and a study (appropriately decorated with a frieze of stylized turbines and engine parts). , , In 1950, the apartment was rented on an 18-year lease to Rene de Montaigu, with the stipulation that he purchase the Art Nouveau woodwork and furnishings.

Around 1895 he turned his hand to painting instead, establishing his professional reputation in an 1896 exhibition at the Georges Petit gallery in Paris; he later became a member of the Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Around 1910 he began to explore the related process of interior decorating, leading to this commission., , Like many of his contemporaries (such as Josef Hoffmann in Austria, Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Scotland, Frank Lloyd Wright in America, Victor Horta in Belgium, and Hector Guimard in France), Levy-Dhurmer worked as an ensemblier, conceiving interiors as &quot;total works of art&quot; by designing not only the architectural setting but also everything down to the door handles and drawer pulls that went into them, so that no single element would offend the eye as inconsistent with the whole.

The care with which Degas observed his model, a ballet student in the Paris Opera named Marie van Goethem, is reflected in the extraordinary number of surviving sketches in charcoal and pastel as well as in the preparatory sculptural study of the figure in the nude., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/The_Little_Fourteen-Year-Old_Dancer_By_Edgar_Degas/ViewObject.aspx?OID=120011285&amp;pgSz=1>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/The_Li...</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: 19thcentury, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: french, ElissaSCA: impressionism, ElissaSCA: ballet, ElissaSCA: degas, ElissaSCA: bronze, ElissaSCA: sculpture, ElissaSCA: statue,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,Artwork,painting_and_sculpture","Sculpture""SET 32","2740945667.jpg","1979.447","Rhyton Terminating in the Forepart of a Wild Cat in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Rhyton terminating in the forepart of a wild cat, 1st century B.C.1st century A.D.; Parthian period, Iran, Gilded silver; H. 10 13/16 in. (27.5 cm), Purchase, Rogers Fund, Enid A. Haupt, Mrs. Donald M. Oenslager, Mrs. Muriel Palitz and Geert C.E. Prins Gifts; Pauline V. Fullerton Bequest; and Bequests of Mary Cushing Fosburgh, Edward C. Moore and Stephen Whitney Phoenix, by exchange, 1979 (1979.447), , Elaborate bowls, animal-headed drinking vessels, and rhytonsvessels with a hole at the front from which liquid flowswere highly valued in ancient Near Eastern society. During the pre-Achaemenid, Achaemenid, and Parthian periods, examples made of silver, gold, and clay were used throughout a vast area extending both to the east and west of Iran. The animals on these vessels included the ram, horse, bull, ibex, supernatural creatures, and female divinities; some were engraved with royal inscriptions. Rhytons made of precious materials were probably luxury wares used at royal courts. Both the rhyton and the animal-headed vessel were adopted by the Greek world as exotic and prestigious Oriental products., , Dating from the Parthian period, this silver rhyton is a fine example of the enduring influence of Hellenistic culture, which owes much to the artistic traditions of Achaemenid Iran. The horn-shaped vessel ends in the forepart of a wild cat; a spout for pouring is in the middle of its chest. A gilded fruit-laden grapevine winds around the animal's chest; at the other end of the rhyton, an ivy wreath encircles the rim. These are the symbols of the Greek god of wine Dionysos, whose cult spread eastward with the invasion of Alexander. Dionysiac imageswild felines, grapevines, and dancing femaleswere absorbed by the Parthians and continued to appear in the art of Near Eastern cultures in the later Sasanian period (224651)., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/wai/ho_1979.447.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/wai/ho_1979.447.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld, ElissaSCA: neareast, ElissaSCA: silver, ElissaSCA: rhyton, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: vase,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 32","3091862135.jpg","-","BM233 Gold Clasp","listentoreason","Visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2005.","'listentoreason: c4040z, listentoreason: favorites, listentoreason: gem, listentoreason: gold, listentoreason: jewlery, listentoreason: metropolitanmuseumofart, listentoreason: score30, listentoreason: america, listentoreason: art, listentoreason: crystal, listentoreason: gemstone, listentoreason: material, listentoreason: metal, listentoreason: mineral, listentoreason: museum, listentoreason: newyork, listentoreason: newyorkcity, listentoreason: olympus, listentoreason: olympusc4040z, listentoreason: places, listentoreason: themet, listentoreason: usa, listentoreason: unitedstates, listentoreason: metropolitanmuseum,','listentoreason: c4040z, listentoreason: favorites, listentoreas,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 32","3092696822.jpg","-","BM188 Ceremonial Plate Armor","listentoreason","Arms and Armor Court.

Valued at the time at the significant sum of $125,000, the house was constructed in the Second Empire style, which was thought to indicate affluence and authority, as well as a cosmopolitan outlook. The Wilcox house was slated for demolition in 1968, and the Museum was able to acquire the front parlor, the rear parlor, and the formal front hall, including the magnificent staircase, as well as the rear parlor's suite of furniture. Together they represent the first known instance of a nineteenth-century American designer, Augustus Truesdell, overseeing and maintaining a consistent idea throughout every aspect of a home's decoration. , , This installation re-creates the rear parlor, complete with an elegant suite of furniture and a matching over mantel mirror, window cornices, lighting fixtures, and marble mantel. While today this style is generally called Renaissance Revival, the furniture makers of its day believed they were following French models and reinterpreting designs fashionable during the reign of Louis XVI. The room's beautifully painted ceiling features rosettes with trompe-l'oeil floral bouquets, all accurately copied from the original parlor. The dramatic twelve-armed chandelier, produced by New York City lighting firm Mitchell, Vance, and Company, picks up aspects of the design motifs found throughout the room. , , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/american_decorative_arts/period_rooms.aspx#15 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/american_decorative_arts/p...</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2009, ElissaSCA: 19thcentury, ElissaSCA: furniture, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,Artwork,period_room","Period_Room""SET 32","4032628569.jpg","-","MotherAndSon_TheMET(6)","rverc","'Mother and Son' Thomas Sully 1840 , , <b><a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/songoftheday/>Song of the Day<a rel=nofollow></a></a></b>, , Dolores O'Riordan - 07.

Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building., , In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list., , The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.

During the pre-Achaemenid, Achaemenid, and Parthian periods, examples made of silver, gold, and clay were used throughout a vast area extending both to the east and west of Iran. The animals on these vessels included the ram, horse, bull, ibex, supernatural creatures, and female divinities; some were engraved with royal inscriptions. Rhytons made of precious materials were probably luxury wares used at royal courts. Both the rhyton and the animal-headed vessel were adopted by the Greek world as exotic and prestigious Oriental products., , Dating from the Parthian period, this silver rhyton is a fine example of the enduring influence of Hellenistic culture, which owes much to the artistic traditions of Achaemenid Iran. The horn-shaped vessel ends in the forepart of a wild cat; a spout for pouring is in the middle of its chest. A gilded fruit-laden grapevine winds around the animal's chest; at the other end of the rhyton, an ivy wreath encircles the rim. These are the symbols of the Greek god of wine Dionysos, whose cult spread eastward with the invasion of Alexander. Dionysiac imageswild felines, grapevines, and dancing femaleswere absorbed by the Parthians and continued to appear in the art of Near Eastern cultures in the later Sasanian period (224651)., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/wai/ho_1979.447.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/wai/ho_1979.447.htm</a>","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld, ElissaSCA: neareast, ElissaSCA: silver, ElissaSCA: rhyton, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: vase, Bijan1351: ashkanian, Bijan1351: persia, Bijan1351: persian,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","2741803382.jpg","34.158","Persian Relief with Two Servants in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Relief: two servants bearing food and drink, 358338 B.C.; Achaemenid period, reign of Artaxerxes III, Excavated at Persepolis, southwestern Iran, Limestone; H. 34 1/16 in.

Persepolis is located thirty miles northeast of Shiraz in the southwest Iranian province of Fars. There, the Hall of One Hundred Columns and the Throne Room of Darius and Xerxes exhibit characteristic features of Achaemenid architecturelarge square rooms, the ceilings of which are supported by many columns. Some of the columns in the Throne Room have been reconstructed and stand more than sixty-five feet high. The column capitals were decorated with the foreparts of bulls, lions, and griffins carved in the round., , Most characteristic of Achaemenid sculpture are the slabs carved in low relief that decorate the various stairways leading to the ceremonial buildings. Representations of hundreds of alternating Persian and Median servants bringing food and drink for a royal feast are on the walls of several palace stairways at Persepolis. This relief fragment depicts a Persian mounting a stairway and holding a heavy water- or wineskin on a tray. Ahead of him on the top step is an armed Median holding a covered vessel.

They celebrated the rites of the god with song, dance, and music in the mountains, often clothed in animal skins. This dancing maenad, clothed in a diaphanous chiton, carries an object characteristic of Dionysos' retinue, the thyrsos, which consists of a fennel stalk crowned with a pinecone and ivy berries. The voluminous garment swirls about her in fanciful, highly expressive folds that evoke her dance. Her introspective expression, so typical of art of the Classical period, contrasts most effectively with the exuberance of her drapery., , In his tragedy, the Bacchae, Euripides describes how women under the spell of Dionysos sing and dance in a state of ecstatic frenzy: , , When the ebony flute, melodious, and sacred, plays the holy song, and thunderously incites the rush of women, to mountain,, then, in delight, like a colt with its mother, at pasture, she frolics, a light-footed Bacchant., , - Euripides, &quot;The Bacchae&quot;","'rosewithoutathorn84: maenad, rosewithoutathorn84: dancing, rosewithoutathorn84: dionysus, rosewithoutathorn84: dionysos, rosewithoutathorn84: classical, rosewithoutathorn84: greek, rosewithoutathorn84: roman, rosewithoutathorn84: ritual, rosewithoutathorn84: cult, rosewithoutathorn84: woman, rosewithoutathorn84: chiton, rosewithoutathorn84: bacchus, rosewithoutathorn84: bacchante, rosewithoutathorn84: bacchae, rosewithoutathorn84: euripides, rosewithoutathorn84: ecstatic, rosewithoutathorn84: metropolitan, rosewithoutathorn84: museum, rosewithoutathorn84: art, rosewithoutathorn84: new, rosewithoutathorn84: york, rosewithoutathorn84: statue,','rosewithoutathorn84: maenad, rosewithoutathorn84: dancing, rose,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","3342907682.jpg","-","Vestal","rosewithoutathorn84","Antonio Canova or his studio, 1757-1822 , Italian, , ,","'rosewithoutathorn84: vestal, rosewithoutathorn84: antonio, rosewithoutathorn84: canova, rosewithoutathorn84: bust, rosewithoutathorn84: classical, rosewithoutathorn84: greek, rosewithoutathorn84: roman, rosewithoutathorn84: beauty, rosewithoutathorn84: sculpture, rosewithoutathorn84: alabaster, rosewithoutathorn84: metropolitan, rosewithoutathorn84: museum, rosewithoutathorn84: art, rosewithoutathorn84: new, rosewithoutathorn84: york, rosewithoutathorn84: statue,','rosewithoutathorn84: vestal, rosewithoutathorn84: antonio, rose,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","3789529731.jpg","-","Head Games","BangsUndeveloped","If you know any that I missed please let me know!","'BangsUndeveloped: newyork, BangsUndeveloped: manhattan, BangsUndeveloped: canong3, BangsUndeveloped: metropolitanmuseumofart, BangsUndeveloped: themet, BangsUndeveloped: art, BangsUndeveloped: statue, BangsUndeveloped: bust, BangsUndeveloped: nyc, BangsUndeveloped: italy,','BangsUndeveloped: newyork, BangsUndeveloped: manhattan, BangsUn,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","3969885909.jpg","-","camel and riders 2 BW","Zhura","Tang dynasty (618-907), late 7th century, Earthenware","'Zhura: metropolitan, Zhura: ny,',3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","3982924843.jpg","-","2007-04-20 NYC MET - Metropolitan Museum of Art part 1","hto2008","<a href=http://www.huatongoversea.com/blog/?p=389 rel=nofollow>More Details</a>, , HuaTongOversea Blog Claim:, , Photos taken with my Canon 400D + Tamron 17-50mm f2.8, are credited and licensed to hto2008 flickr account and , www(dot)HuaTongOversea(dot)com/blog,","'hto2008: 20070420, hto2008: nyc, hto2008: met, hto2008: metropolitan, hto2008: museum, hto2008: art,','hto2008: 20070420, hto2008: nyc, hto2008: met, hto2008: metropo,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","3983687628.jpg","-","2007-04-20 NYC MET - Metropolitan Museum of Art part 1","hto2008","<a href=http://www.huatongoversea.com/blog/?p=389 rel=nofollow>More Details</a>, , HuaTongOversea Blog Claim:, , Photos taken with my Canon 400D + Tamron 17-50mm f2.8, are credited and licensed to hto2008 flickr account and , www(dot)HuaTongOversea(dot)com/blog,","'hto2008: 20070420, hto2008: nyc, hto2008: met, hto2008: metropolitan, hto2008: museum, hto2008: art,','hto2008: 20070420, hto2008: nyc, hto2008: met, hto2008: metropo,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","3987783095.jpg","-","LbubNYCart483","qpkarl","I think it's clear what most camels are trying to tell us.

Harkness, 1917 (17.9.1), , This well-formed statuette of a hippopotamus demonstrates the Egyptian artist's appreciation for the natural world. It was molded in faience, a ceramic material made of ground quartz. Beneath the blue-green glaze, the body was painted with the outlines of river plants, symbolizing the marshes in which the animal lived., , The seemingly benign appearance that this figurine presents is deceptive. To the ancient Egyptians, the hippopotamus was one of the most dangerous animals in their world. The huge creatures were a hazard for small fishing boats and other rivercraft. The beast might also be encountered on the waterways in the journey to the afterlife. As such, the hippopotamus was a force of nature that needed to be propitiated and controlled, both in this life and the next. This example was one of a pair found in a shaft associated with the tomb chapel of the steward Senbi II at Meir, an Upper Egyptian site about thirty miles south of modern Asyut. Three of its legs have been restored because they were purposely broken to prevent the creature from harming the deceased. The hippo was part of Senbi's burial equipment, which included a canopic box (also in the Metropolitan Museum), a coffin, and numerous models of boats and food production., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/hippopotamus/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100000444 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>  addl accession","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld, ElissaSCA: sculpture, ElissaSCA: egypt, ElissaSCA: egyptian, ElissaSCA: faience, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: statuette, ElissaSCA: figurine, ElissaSCA: hippo, ElissaSCA: blue,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 32","4032696965.jpg","-","NYC.MET.Charcoal drawer","glazzeye","I asked this fellow - who was fine tuning his drawing of this lion - if I could take a picture.

Hansen Egyptian Purchase Fund, 2000 (2000.485), , This imposing lion once guarded the entrance to the pyramid-age sanctuary. AS the most powerful predator of the steppes bordering the Nile Valley, the lion was a symbol of royalty from early on. The animal--especially the female--also embodied a number of deities. This work is the earliest extant example of a lifesized lion statue that is almost entirely preserved. It was excavated by the British Egypt Exploration Fund in 1891, at Herakleopolis Magna in the Nile Valley, southeast of the Fayum Oasis., , **, The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world. It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building., , In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list., , The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.

The original bronze probably stood in a sanctuary such as that at Olympia or <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594146094534/>Delphi</a>, where games were regularly held. The Greek sculptor Polykleitos of Argos, who worked during the mid-fifth century B.C., was one of the most famous artists of the ancient world. His figures are carefully designed with special attention to bodily proportions and stance. The figure's thorax and pelvis tilt in opposite directions, setting up rhythmic contrasts in the torso that create an impression of organic vitality. The position of the feet-poised between standing and walking--gives a sense of potential movement. This rigorously calculated pose, which is found in almost all works attributed to Polykleitos, became a standard formula used in Graeco-Roman and later Western European art., , **, The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.

Although the stele is said to be from Attica, the simplified treatment of the pediment, the somewhat stiff pose of the figure, and the type of marble suggest that it was carved in Boeotia. A flat area at the upper right of the relief has been worked over with a claw chisel, leaving short, parallel, toothlike marks. Such marks would be unlikely on finished grave reliefs of the classical period, for they would have been smoothed with a flat chisel. The presence of the marks suggests that the stele was reworked at a later time. A number of stelai with similar reworked surfaces have been found at Thespiae in Boeotia. During the Roman period, the Thespians reused ancestral gravestones from the late fifth and fourth centuries BC to mark the graves of their own dead.
