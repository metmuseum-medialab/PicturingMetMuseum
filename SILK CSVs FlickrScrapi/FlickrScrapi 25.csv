They were active in Lutheran Nuremberg until 1525, when they were expelled. Barthel moved to Catholic Munich to work for the Bavarian dukes William IV and Ludwig X. Shown with a proud gaze and boldly crossed arms, the sitter of this arresting portrait was chancellor to William IV, and a powerful opponent of the Reformation. He was born into a noble Bavarian family, and went on to study law in Germany and Italy. As chancellor, von Eck ardently championed the Wittelsbach cause against the Habsburg monarchy, and tried to suppress every demonstration of Protestantism.

Her sparkling eyes compete with the stars on the garish wallpaper behind her, presumably the same paper that decorated their rooms at the Hotel du Tigre.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/modern_art/dora_maar_in_an_armchair_pablo_picasso//objectview.aspx?OID=210007255&amp;collID=21&amp;dd1=21 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/modern...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: picasso,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: spanish,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: portrait,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 25","5002483701.jpg","-","BarbizonPainting_TheMET(3)(PAN)","rverc","NA","rverc: europeanpaintings,rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,rverc: met,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 25","3983006122.jpg","60.83.7","Spouted Jug with Raised Concentric Circles in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2008","ElissaSCA","Spouted Jug with Raised Concentric Circles ;Ceramic;Northwestern Anatolia;Early Bronze Age II, 2700-2400 BC;;Accession # 60.83.7;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bronzeage,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 25","4050690385.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 25","4552840651.jpg","17.194.281","Gold-Glass Mosaic Bowl in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Gold-glass mosaic bowl;;Medium; Technique: Glass; cast;;Culture: Greek;;Period: Hellenistic;;Date: 2nd century B.C.;;Dimensions: Overall: 4 3/8 x 6 1/2in.

The fluted column, with most of the shaft omitted, was reconstituted from one or more similar columns and would have stood over fifty-six feet high in its original location. Of particularly fine workmanship is the carving of the foliate ornaments on the Ionic capital, as well as the scale pattern on the torus (foliated base).;This column was once part of the Temple of Artemis at Sardis, one of the cities of western Asia Minor in which Greek influence was continually interwoven with local tradition. After the conquest of Alexander the Great, Sardis became part of the Seleucid empire, which spanned Asia Minor, the Levant, Persia, and as far east as India. Consistent with the predilection for enormous scale already manifest in Archaic temples in western Asia Minor, for instance at Ephesus and Didyma, the one at Sardis ranks among the seven largest of all Greek temples.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 25","3174066319.jpg","-","LNYCart466","qpkarl","<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Oceania rel=nofollow>Oceanic art</a> at the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 25","3990224045.jpg","12.229.12","Fragmentary Kylix Attributed to the Kalliope Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2009","ElissaSCA","Fragmentary Terracotta Kylix (drinking cup);Greek, Attic, red-figure, ca. 430 BC;Attributed to the Kalliope Painter;Interior: Apollo and Kalliope;Exterior: lower bodies of two figures;;Accession # 12.229.12;;The Kalliope Painter was a somewhat older colleague in the same workshop as the Eretria Painter.

The firstthe Akkadian Empire (23502150 B.C.) was centered at Agade, a city still not located by archaeologists but probably near modern Baghdad. The official language of this empire was Akkadian, a Semitic language that differed greatly from Sumerian, which previously had been the predominant language of Mesopotamia. In addition to its political and economic innovations in administering a large territory, the Akkadian court produced innovative art in a powerful and naturalistic style.;;This magnificent head portrays a king of the late third millennium B.C. Its heavy-lidded eyes, prominent but unexaggerated nose, full lips, and enlarged ears all suggest a portrait of an actual person. While the date and place of manufacture of this piece have been much debated, its close similarity to the magnificent bronze head found at Nineveh make a late third millennium date most likely. The head is cast almost solid (making it extremely heavy), but a dowel hole at the base would have served to join it to a body or other support, most likely for display in a temple setting.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 25","4266698186.jpg","-","Lmetart-364p","qpkarl","William Wetmore Story (18191895);Cleopatra;1858; this carving, 1869;Marble;55 1/2 x 33 1/4 x 51 1/2 in.

Christ's encounter with two disciples traveling from Jerusalem to the town of Emmaus is depicted at the top. The disciples, not recognizing the stranger who has joined them, lament Christ's crucifixion. Before revealing himself, Christ impresses them with his knowledge of the prophets' teachings. The travelers are equipped with appropriate travel gearstaff, water gourd, and purseand their spirited discussion is emphasized by their lively stride. In the lower register, Christ appears to Mary Magdalene, who stood weeping outside Jesus' empty tomb. When she recognizes him, Christ forbids her to touch him, but to report his resurrection to the disciples. The inscription, which refers to this dialogue, reads &quot;the Lord speaks to Mary.&quot;;;The drama of both these narratives is effectively conveyed through the threatrical and often exaggerated gestures and movements. The swirling drapery with pearled borders similarly emphasizes the action.

Hansen Egyptian Purchase Fund, and Magda Saleh and Jack Josephson Gift, 2003 (2003.154);;The fluid pose and chest-beating gesture of this extraordinary figure evokes a stately performance. Egyptian relief representations depict figures like this as part of a troupe of similarly genuflecting divine beings with falcon- and jackal-heads. This troupe is usually seen attending the sunrise or the birth and coronation of a king; and three-dimensional figures of the same type were set around the processional shrines of certain gods, doubtlessly to accompany the epiphany of the deity during a procession.;;It is not easy to explain the presence among the animal-headed divinities of the human-headed figure wearingas seen herethe regalia of a pharaoh. Some scholars interpret the figure as the representation of an actual king. Others understand it as a mythical being that introduces royal aspects into the otherworldly ritual. Whatever its exact meaning, this masterpiece of the wood carver was certainly part of a temple's equipment. Its ritual character was further emphasized by a covering of lead sheet, now vanished.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2003.154 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2003.154</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ptolemaic,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 25","4985674472.jpg","29.3.2","Hatshepsut Seated in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2008","ElissaSCA","Hatshepsut, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18, reign of Hatshepsut, ca. 14731458 b.c.;Egyptian; From Deir el-Bahri, western Thebes;Indurated limestone ;H. 76 3/4 in.

(41.5 cm);Rogers Fund, 1918 (18.2.4);;This is the only preserved three-dimensional representation that has been identified as Sahure, the second ruler of Dynasty 5. Seated on a throne, the king is accompanied by a smaller male figure personifying the local god of the Coptite nome, the fifth nome (province) of Upper Egypt. This deity offers the king an ankh (hieroglyph meaning &quot;life&quot;) with his left hand. The nome standard, with its double-falcon emblem, is carved above the god's head. Sahure wears the nemes headcloth and straight false beard of a living pharaoh. The flaring hood of the uraeus, the cobra goddess who protected Egyptian kings, is visible on his brow. The nome god wears the archaic wig and curling beard of a deity.;;The statue may have been intended to decorate the king's pyramid complex at Abusir, about fifteen miles south of Giza. At the end of the previous dynasty, multiple statues of this type were placed in the temple of Menkaure (Mycerinus) to symbolize the gathering of nome gods from Upper and Lower Egypt around the king. However, since no other statues of this type are preserved from Sahure's reign, it is possible that this statue was a royal dedication in one of the temples in Coptos (modern Qift).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/oking/ho_18.2.4.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/oking/ho_18.2.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 25","5000551984.jpg","48.111","The Royal Acquaintenances Memi and Sabu in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2008","ElissaSCA","Statue of Memi and Sabu, Old Kingdom, Dynasty 4, ca. 25752465 b.c.;Egyptian; Probably from Giza;Painted limestone ;H. 24 3/8 in. (62 cm);Rogers Fund, 1948 (48.111);;Pair statues, usually depicting a husband and wife, were frequently placed in a serdab, the hidden statue chamber often found in nonroyal tomb chapels of the Old Kingdom. The Egyptians believed that the spirit of the deceased could use such a statue as a home and enter it in order to benefit from gifts of food that were brought to the offering chapel of the tomb.;;The inscription on the front of this statue identifies these individuals as the Royal Acquaintance Memi and Sabu. Although the text does not specify a relationship, they were probably husband and wife, as is common for pair statues where a relationship is recorded. The pose is unusual because Memi is returning Sabu's embrace by draping his arm around her shoulders. This restricting gesture may account for the fact that he stands with his feet together, rather than striding forward in the normal masculine pose.;;Until recently, this statue was dated to Dynasty 5, but the figures have many features in common with Fourth Dynasty statues found in the nonroyal cemeteries surrounding the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) at Giza.
