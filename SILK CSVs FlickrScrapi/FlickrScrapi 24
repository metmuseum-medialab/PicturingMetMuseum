(10.8 cm), Diam. 3 7/8 in. (9.9 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1959 (59.11.14);;As in modern times, sports were incredibly popular in the Roman world. The two principal games were gladiatorial battles, fought in arenas such as the Colosseum in Rome, and chariot races held in circuses like the Circus Maximus, also in Rome. Participants in these contests were hailed as heroes and acquired a great deal of fame, if not fortune. The games also sponsored an entire industry that produced what we might call &quot;souvenir&quot; merchandise, including a number of different types of glass vessels. For example, in the first century A.D., mold-blown sports cups depicting gladiators or charioteers were extremely popular. Similar scenes could also be painted onto glass vessels or, as in this example, engraved onto the exterior of the object. Like the mold-blown gladiator cup (81.10.245) in the Metropolitan's collection, this free-blown beaker shows a sporting event in progress.;;A charioteer races his quadriga (four-horse chariot) in front of a small, latticed structure toward two standing figures, one of whom holds forth an unidentifiable object. The latticed fencelike structure may be a representation of the central spina of a racing circus, which served to separate the two directions of racing and prevent head-on collisions, much like the one that once existed in the Circus Maximus in Rome. The first of the four horses (closest to the chariot) is shown in three-quarter view, with the hindlegs of his three companions lined up beneath him and the forelegs of all four horses stretched forward to indicate the speed at which they travel. A row of diagonal hatch marks indicates the ground line. A Greek inscription runs along the top of the beaker, naming the charioteer Eutyches, who is known from other chariot cups, and his four horses, though only three of their names are still legible: Arethousimos, Nilos, and Pyripnous.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/59.11.14 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/59.11.14</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: glass,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: chariot,ElissaSCA: lateantique,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5025188103.jpg","-","A piece of the MET","Keewon","NA","Keewon: met,Keewon: metropolitanmuseumofart,Keewon: nyc2010,Keewon: newyork,Keewon: manhattan,Keewon: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5043518252.jpg","52.184","-","-","addl  Panoramic View of the Palace and Gardens of Versailles John Vanderlyn (American, Kingston, New York 1775–1852 Kingston, New York) Date: 1818–19 Medium: Oil on canvas Accession Number: 52.184 On view in Gallery 735","3D,Art2or3,period_room,Artwork","Period_Room""SET 24","5050061987.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5059234178.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5059234182.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5059234184.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5059247655.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5059247657.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5059247659.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5063613769.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5065680348.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5065680354.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5065704768.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5065704772.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5065704778.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5065704780.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5066900534.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5066900540.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5067081180.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5067134948.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5071251415.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5071251639.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5071251895.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5071252029.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5071856898.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5071857310.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 24","5074290568.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,Artwork,tapestry","Tapestry""SET 24","5101458986.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5105826233.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5106421120.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5105826301.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5110868589.jpg","74.51.316","Phoenician Glass Beads in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Glass eye beads;;Medium;

The theme, symbolizing the prowess of Sasanian rulers, was used to decorate these royal plates, which were often sent as gifts to neighboring courts. The king has various royal attributes: a crown and fillet, covered globe, nimbus with beaded border, and beaded chest halter with fluttering ribbons. The identity of the Sasanian king on this plate is uncertain. His crown identifies him as either Peroz (r. 459484) or Kavad I (r. 488497, 499531).;;Sasanian silver bowls were usually hammered into shape and then decorated in various complex techniques. On this plate, separate pieces of silver were inserted into lips cut up from the plate to provide high relief. The vessel was then gilded using an amalgam of mercury and gold, which could be painted onto the surface, and nielloa metallic alloy of sulfur and silverwas inlaid. The result was a vessel of varied surface contours and colors.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/ancient_near_eastern_art/plate_with_king_hunting_rams//objectview.aspx?OID=30001627&amp;collID=3&amp;dd1=3 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/ancien...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: sasanian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: plate,ElissaSCA: king,ElissaSCA: horse,ElissaSCA: ram,ElissaSCA: animal,ElissaSCA: silver,ElissaSCA: gold,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5111611134.jpg","-","Eagle","IslesPunkFan","Gilded pine;1800-1830;;Photo taken on a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on 3/5/10.","IslesPunkFan: met,IslesPunkFan: metropolitanmuseum,IslesPunkFan: metroploitanmuseumofart,IslesPunkFan: art,IslesPunkFan: museum,IslesPunkFan: history,IslesPunkFan: newyork,IslesPunkFan: ny,IslesPunkFan: nyc,IslesPunkFan: manhattan,IslesPunkFan: eagle,IslesPunkFan: pine,IslesPunkFan: statue,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","5118967429.jpg","59.130.1","Sasanian Oval Bowl with Grapevine Scrolls in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Oval bowl with grapevine scrolls inhabited by birds and animals;;Period: Sasanian;;Date: A.D. 6th7th century;;Geography: Iran;;Medium: Silver, mercury gilding;;Dimensions: 2.76 x 4.37 x 9.17 in.

Even more, it recalls the dialogue between Eve and the serpent in the Book of Genesis.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_and_roman_art/terracotta_jug//objectview.aspx?OID=130000584&amp;collID=13&amp;dd1=13 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: painting,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 24","997653872.jpg","31.11.10","Black-Figure Lekythos by the Amasis Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Lekythos, ca. 550530 B.C.; Archaic, black-figure;Attributed to the Amasis Painter;Greek, Attic;Terracotta; H. 6 3/4 in.

Here, he is shown approaching the disconsolate Penelope, as the faithful members of his household - his father Laertes, his son Telemachos, and the swineherd Eumaios - look on. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=30.11.9>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;vie...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,The Lady of Shalot: homer,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","2171160304.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3172700123.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3175980060.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3176915585.jpg","-","LNYCart645","qpkarl","Aroused miniature bronze figurines at the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3176916387.jpg","-","LNYCart631","qpkarl","A bronze bird at the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York rel=nofollow>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, New York City.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3212105450.jpg","-","The temple or tombs or something like that","konstantin sergeyev","metropolitan museum of art, nyc","konstantin sergeyev: themet,konstantin sergeyev: metropolitanmuseumofart,konstantin sergeyev: newyork,konstantin sergeyev: nyc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3975275512.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3984214147.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","3994907556.jpg","18.12.11","Bronze Askos in the Form of a Goatskin in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, June 2009","ElissaSCA","Bronze Askos (flask) in the Form of a Goatskin;Greek, 3rd-1st century BC;;Accession # 18.12.11;;Goatskins were used as containers for wine in antiquity.

During this period, a number of minor rulers maintained their independence at the margins of the empire. Among them were the kingdoms of Urkish and Nawar in northern Mesopotamia, a Hurrian-speaking area.;;Based on its inscription, this bronze foundation peg in the form of a snarling lion almost certainly comes from the city of Urkish, modern Tell Mozan.

Weber, 1992 (1992.165.20ab);;This mortuary vessel, known as a hu, is decorated with the animated drama of a blue beast with bared fangs lunging at a mounted archer. Roaming the other side of the hu is a long, striding tiger. Executed with brilliant pigments and confident black brushstrokes, the decoration on this vessel perfectly expresses the boldly assertive character of the Western Han dynasty and is, moreover, one of the finest known examples of Han painting.;;The iconography of the decor is celestial: the blue beast represents the star Sirius, known in China as the Heavenly Wolf, and the archer is a personification of the adjoining constellation, Bow, whose arrow always points directly at the Wolf star. Their companion on the other side is the White Tiger, consmological symbol of the West, whose domain in the night sky borders that of the Wolf and Bow.;;The Wolf is a baleful star. He governs thievery and looting and represents the &quot;barbarian&quot; Xiongnu tribes that warred with the Han people on the northwestern borders of China. It is said that when the twinklings of the Wolf star change color, banditry will curse the land; when the star shifts from its normal position, the Xiongnu will be on the warpath. Fortunately, there is the vigilant Bow, who &quot;punishes rebels and knows those who are crafty and evil.&quot; Forever pointed at the Wolf, across whose body is an array of ill-boding meteors, the Bow was considered the protector of China. Interestingly, the mounted archer, the eternal image of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes, is shown hunting the symbolic representation of the Xiongnu.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.165.20ab rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.165.20ab</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: jar,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5152938793.jpg","-","NA","michael cinque","NYC, 1989/90.","michael cinque: 198990,michael cinque: blackandwhite,michael cinque: bw,michael cinque: streetphotography,michael cinque: newyork,michael cinque: newyorkcity,michael cinque: manhattan,michael cinque: gotham,michael cinque: metropolis,michael cinque: metropolitanmuseumofart,michael cinque: people,michael cinque: thebigapple,michael cinque: film,michael cinque: 35mm,michael cinque: trix,michael cinque: nikon,michael cinque: michaelcinque,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5153249314.jpg","-","TheAmericanWing_TheMET (236)","rverc","NA","rverc: amercianwing,rverc: sculpture,rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5153255728.jpg","-","TheAmericanWing_TheMET (235)","rverc","NA","rverc: amercianwing,rverc: sculpture,rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5155570231.jpg","1989.281.4","Sumerian Standing Male Worshiper in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2010","ElissaSCA","Standing Male Worshiper;Copper alloy;Mesopotamia;Early Dynastic IIIb, 2500-2350 BC;;Accession Number: 1989.281.4;;Inscribed: To the goddess Ninegal, Lu-Kesh the scribe, son of Ur-Ninurta, has dedicated [this statue];;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label;;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: sumerian,ElissaSCA: mesopotamia,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: figurine,ElissaSCA: bronzeage,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5155773501.jpg","1998.380","Standing Female Wearing a Strap and a Necklace in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Standing female figure wearing a strap and a necklace;;Period: Bronze Age;;Date: 3rd2nd millennium B.C.;;Geography: Southwestern Arabia;;Medium: Sandstone, quartzite;;Dimensions: H. 27 cm, W. 14.3 cm, D. 14.3 cm;;Classification: Stone-Sculpture;;Credit Line: Purchase, Fletcher, Louis V. Bell, and Rogers Funds, and The Tokyo Shimbun and Friends of Inanna Gifts, 1998;;Accession Number: 1998.380;;;Description: ;;This sculpture is one of a group of statues associated with the South Arabian Bronze Age. It comes at the beginning of a figural tradition characterized by extreme simplification and symbolic strength. Represented is a standing female with a role of fat and deep groove emphasizing the belly and a clearly indicated pubic triangle. Her massive body is contained within a quadrangular space. The legs look truncated but the toes, like the hands and fingers, are indicated by incisions. She wears a strap across her body and a necklace. Subject and style invite comparison with Near Eastern and Aegean Neolithic statuary and with much later South Arabian statuary of the second century B.C. In early Anatolia and Greeceas in late Paleolithic Europenude females were dynamic, with curved, exaggeraged breasts, belly, and buttocks. By contrast, the frontal, profile, and back planes of the South Arabian sculpture are separated, emphasizing abstraction and containment within a blocklike formfeatures that characterize figural art of the region more than two thousand years later. Other similar statues were found near western highland settlements and the inner Hadramawt area. A few males appear ithyphallic, suggesting that these human or divine images were used in fertility rituals. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/ancient_near_eastern_art/standing_female_figure_wearing_a_strap_and_a_necklace//objectview.aspx?OID=30006233&amp;collID=3&amp;dd1=3 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/ancien...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5156136476.jpg","47.100.87","Persian Vessel in the Form of a Horse's Head in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Vessel in the form of a horse's head;;Period: Achaemenid;;Date: 5th century B.C.;;Geography: Iran;;Medium: Silver, gilding;;Dimensions: 8.03 in.

Fragments were acquired by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1911, 1921, 1936, 1938, and 1951. The fragment with the girl's head, here in a plaster copy, was acquired in 1903 by the Berlin Museum; the fragment with the youth's right forearm, also a plaster cast here, is in the National Museum in Athens. The capital and crowning sphinx are casts of the originals, displayed in a case nearby. ;;The youth on the shaft is shown as an athlete, with an aryballos (oil flask) suspended from his wrist. Athletics were an important part of every boy's education, and oil was used as a cleanser after exercise. He holds a pomegranatea fruit associated with both fecundity and death in Greek mythsperhaps indicating that he had reached puberty before his death.

(20.8 x 35 cm);Charlotte C. and John C. Weber Collection, Gift of Charlotte C. and John C. Weber, 1992 (1992.165.20ab);;This mortuary vessel, known as a hu, is decorated with the animated drama of a blue beast with bared fangs lunging at a mounted archer. Roaming the other side of the hu is a long, striding tiger. Executed with brilliant pigments and confident black brushstrokes, the decoration on this vessel perfectly expresses the boldly assertive character of the Western Han dynasty and is, moreover, one of the finest known examples of Han painting.;;The iconography of the decor is celestial: the blue beast represents the star Sirius, known in China as the Heavenly Wolf, and the archer is a personification of the adjoining constellation, Bow, whose arrow always points directly at the Wolf star. Their companion on the other side is the White Tiger, consmological symbol of the West, whose domain in the night sky borders that of the Wolf and Bow.;;The Wolf is a baleful star. He governs thievery and looting and represents the &quot;barbarian&quot; Xiongnu tribes that warred with the Han people on the northwestern borders of China. It is said that when the twinklings of the Wolf star change color, banditry will curse the land; when the star shifts from its normal position, the Xiongnu will be on the warpath. Fortunately, there is the vigilant Bow, who &quot;punishes rebels and knows those who are crafty and evil.&quot; Forever pointed at the Wolf, across whose body is an array of ill-boding meteors, the Bow was considered the protector of China. Interestingly, the mounted archer, the eternal image of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes, is shown hunting the symbolic representation of the Xiongnu.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.165.20ab rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.165.20ab</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: jar,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5152652131.jpg","-","TheAmericanWing_TheMET(233)","rverc","NA","rverc: amercianwing,rverc: sculpture,rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 24","5167941065.jpg","17.190.185","Shrine of the Virgin in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2009","ElissaSCA","Title: Shrine of the Virgin;;Date: ca. 1300;;Geography: Made in Rhine valley;;Culture: German;;Medium: Oak, linen covering, polychromy, gilding, gesso;;Dimensions: Overall: 14 1/2 x 13 5/8 x 5 1/8in.
