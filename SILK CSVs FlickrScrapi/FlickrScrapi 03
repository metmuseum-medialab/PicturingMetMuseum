My intent is to take it another 500 paintings.;This time, I will introduce a new scheme. I will keep score for each grouping of 100 paintings. The first grouping will encompass numbers 501 -600.;The winner of the first grouping of 100 will receive a Hard Cover copy of the Metropolitan's new publication: Balthus: Cats and Girls and a mailed Metropolitan postcard (my choice) acknowledging their participation. Second through Fifth place will also receive a Metropolitan postcard.;Changes:;Rather than 2 paintings each day, as the case with the previous group of 500, there will be only 1 each day. Posting will take place sometime after 8:00 PM EST, five days a week (Sunday; Monday; Tuesday; Wednesday; Thursday. There are no IDs on Friday or Saturday);Correct answers are allotted points in the following way:;First correct respondent receives 6 points;Second: 5 points;third: 4 points;fourth: 3 points;fifth: 2 points;;Each respondent after that receives 1 point, whether the artist named is correct or not. Respondent must, however enter the name of an artist in some context to the painting (i.e.: &quot;this painting reminds me of &quot;???????&quot;'s work, etc.);comments that merely discuss the painting or photograph (although welcome) will not be awarded a point.;As you might surmise then, incorrect responses will be awarded a point (there is no penalty for trying).;;The opportunity to accrue points can only happen within a maximum of 24 hours. Once the Painting is elevated and the artist identified, no additional scoring (for that painting can occur). ( in other words, regardless of pleas, points will not be awarded for a comment/ID made days after the posting);;A summary of scores for the top five positions will be published each Sunday, at the beginning of each set of five photographs.;Caveats / Understanding:;Postings may be held up due to circumstances beyond my control.;Delays in posting my occur each evening.

Leutze began his first version of this subject in 1849. It was damaged in his studio by fire in 1850 and, although restored and acquired by the Bremen Kunsthalle, was again destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942. In 1850, Leutze began this version of the subject, which was placed on exhibition in New York during October of 1851. At this showing Marshall O. Roberts bought the canvas for the then-enormous sum of $10,000. In 1853, M. Knoedler published an engraving of it.

The image of down-home simplicity embodied by the cider makers was evoked by the Whig candidate, William Henry Harrison, promoted as a common man who preferred a log cabin and hard cider to the supposed excesses of the Democratic White House of Martin Van Buren. The work was commissioned by the prominent New York businessman and Whig leader Charles Augustus Davis. Davis was the creator of the folksy &quot;Jack Downing&quot; character, whose musings broadened Whig appeal through attacks on the disastrous Jacksonian financial policies responsible for the Panic of 1837. Mount, a conservative Democrat who opposed the populist Jackson, punctuated his painting with details, such as the prominently dated cider barrel, possibly intended to allude to the larger political context. In 1841, a Whig journalist wove the references into an anecdote in the &quot;New York American&quot; ripe with political insinuations and double meanings. Probably with greater specificity than the artist intended, he likened each figure to a character or interest group in the election. It is likely that Mount's motives included both subtle political concerns and a commitment to the transcription of visual data gleaned directly from his rural surroundings. The cider mill immortalized here stood in Setauket, Long Island, until the early twentieth century.&quot;;;<a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/20011980?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=william+sidney+mount&amp;pos=1 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/2001...</a>;;... addl Cider Making William Sidney Mount (American, Setauket, New York 1807–1868 Setauket, New York ) Date: 1840–41 Medium: Oil on canvas Accession Number: 66.126 On view in Gallery 758","NA,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 03","9310159831.jpg","99.31","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

(203.84 cm);Gift of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 1932 (32.11.4);;;;The Amazons were a mythical race of warrior women renowned for their skills in archery and horsemanship. This marble statue depicting a wounded Amazon is a Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 450425 B.C. The original bronze may have stood in the sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesus on the coast of Asia Minor, where the Amazons had legendary and cultic connections with the goddess.;;Here, the mythical warrior woman has been stripped of her weapons and horse, and wounded under her right breast. She wears a short, sleeveless chiton unfastened at one shoulder and belted at the waist with a makeshift bit of bridle from her horse. The garment is known as an exomis, the type of clothing worn by Greek men for exercise, horse riding, or hard labor. Despite her plight, this Amazon shows no sign of pain or fatigue. She gently leans on the pillar at her left and rests her right arm gracefully on her head in a gesture often used to denote sleep or death. The serenity of her pose and the emotional restraint in her facial expression are characteristic of Classical sculpture of the second half of the fifth century B.C.;;The Roman writer Pliny the Younger describes a competition held in the mid-fifth century B.C. between five famous sculptors, including Pheidias, Polykleitos, and Kresilas, who were to make a statue of an Amazon for the temple of Artemis. This type of statue, which is reproduced in other marble copies, is generally associated with that contest.;;Of this marble copy, the lower legs and feet have been restored with plaster casts taken from other marble copies of this type in Berlin and Copenhagen. Most of the right, the lower end of the left forearm, the lower part of the pillar, and the plinth are eighteenth-century marble restorations. However, the sharply carved facial features and the crisply carved curls indicate a faithful rendering of the bronze original.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/god1/hod_32.11.4.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/god1/hod_32.11.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: classical,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: amazon,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: copy,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: drawing,ElissaSCA: reconstruction,ElissaSCA: ancient,2D,Art2or3,Artwork,drawing","Drawing""SET 03","9580820129.jpg","-","The Girl and Art","Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views)","NA","Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): washington,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): dc,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): museum,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): girl,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): art,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 03","9639820899.jpg","-","New York - Metropolitan Museum of Art","Allan482","European paintings","NA,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 03","9690942294.jpg","-","New York - Metropolitan Museum of Art - Rembrandt van Rijn","Allan482","NA","Allan482: newyork,Allan482: usa,Allan482: metmuseum,Allan482: fujixe1,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 03","9702255995.jpg","19.164","Empty Benches TheMET(141new)","rverc","Pieter Bruegal the Elder Netherlandish, Breda(?) ca. 1525-1569 Brussels;<b><i> The Harvesters </i></b> 1565;Oil on wood;;This panel belongs to a series commissioned by the Antwerp merchant Niclaes Jongelinck for his suburban home.

It ranks alongside the greatest Venetian nudes, such as Titian's Venus of Urbino (Uffizi, Florence), but it also enriches the genre by virtue of Lotto's individual wit and insistence on representing a real woman, with warm brown eyes, a longish nose, and a tender half-smile.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/eustn/hod_1986.138.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/eustn/hod_1986.138.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: venus,ElissaSCA: aphrodite,ElissaSCA: goddess,ElissaSCA: mythology,ElissaSCA: renaissance,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 03","2989056782.jpg","29.131.3r1–r2","Dutch Interior by Miro in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Joan Miro.

Van Gogh remarked that &quot;she had a good eye and took the best.&quot; He began the portraits just before his breakdown in Arles, in December 1888, and completed them in early 1889. As he worked on the successive versions, the composition (which he titled La Berceuse, meaning &quot;lullaby, or woman who rocks the cradle,&quot; indicated by the rope the sitter holds) took on added meaning. As he revealed in his letters, the maternal image became the locus of literary and symbolic associations, ranging from the writings of Dutch and French novelists to the consoling music of Berlioz and Wagner.

Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expressionall of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a).;;Reconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. ;;The overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor. In fact, the boots Gallus wears are of a type often shown in representations of boxers, and would have been more appropriate for the palaestra, or exercise yard, than the imperial court.;;Although his pose is one routinely adopted by Roman emperorsrecalling Greek heroic and athletic nude statuesthe disproportion, wrestling gear, brutish crew cut, and stubble beard no longer evoke the ideals of classical Greece as in the days of Augustus. The technique of negative carving, which had been designed in the early third century for stone portraits of Caracalla, is here successfully used in the decoration of metal. This abbreviated style befits Gallus, an emperor who both achieved and lost the throne at the hands of the soldiers he led.; ;Text (slightly abridged) from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm</a>;;For an article on the conservation of this work: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_2003/roman.asp rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_...</a>;;and;;Bronze statue of the emperor Trebonianus Gallus;Roman, 251-253 AD;Said to have been found near the church of Saint John the Lateran in Rome;;Accession # 05.30;;This monumental bronze statue is one of the very few nearly complete Roman bronze statues of the third century preserved today. It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different. Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived. Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos. In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism. Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or a short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand. ;;The statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth centur","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: trebonianusgallus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: portrait,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 03","1057277358.jpg","14.130.8","Marble Pediment of a Funerary Altar in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble pediment of a funerary altar;Roman, Hadrianic period, ca. 120-130 AD;;Accession # 14.130.8;;This fragment of an altar is from a commemorative monument in which identifying inscriptions would have appeared on the shaft below the three portrait busts.

(157.5 cm);The Cesnola Collection, Purchased by subscription, 1874-76 (74.51.2453);;On the long sides: (A) procession of two chariots, two horsemen, (B) two chariots, two footmen; on the short sides: (A) mother goddesses, (B) Bes;;The Amathus sarcophagus, arguably the single most important object in the Cesnola Collection at the Metropolitan Museum, is unique among ancient Cypriot sculptures in its monumentality, its exceptionally high relief, and the preservation of its polychrome.;;The primary scenes on the long sides of the sarcophagus depict a procession of chariots escorted by attendants on horseback and followed by foot soldiers. Most likely, the figure standing under a parasol in the first chariot represents the deceased. His horses, like the others, are richly caparisoned, but the wheels of his chariot have fewer spokes. Splendidly embellished horses and chariot poles are part of a long tradition on Cyprus, although scholars have suggested that the prototypes for the chariot procession on the Amathus sarcophagus may have been Graeco-Persian reliefs.;;One of the short sides of the sarcophagus originally was decorated with four figures of the Egyptian god Bes. The cult of Bes was especially popular at Amathus, primarily because of the Phoenician presence in the city. The other short side of the sarcophagus shows four standing figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte. Nude except for their ornate necklaces, the four figures of the goddess hold their breasts in a pose that is well attested in Cypriot terracotta sculpture from the sixth century B.C. The temple of Astarte, located on the acropolis of Amathus, was one of the most important sanctuaries on Cyprus. The depictions of Bes and Astarte on this particular sarcophagus suggest the importance of procreation to the deceased.;;Most of the architectural moldings and the decorative details on the sarcophagus, such as the carved palmettes and ivy leaves that fill the four panels, are of eastern Greek origin. Other floral motifs, such as the tree of life and a frieze of lotus flowers and buds, had a long tradition in Cypriot vase painting and other arts of the Archaic and later periods. The figural panels are framed by a variety of vegetal ornaments, while the gabled lid once featured a pair of sphinxes and a palmette at each end. The thorough integration of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Cypriot stylistic elements on the Amathus sarcophagus is characteristic of Cypriot art and culture during the fifth century B.C.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 03","2072708768.jpg","42.201.7","Marble Statuette of a Male Figure with Shaggy Hair in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble statuette of a male figure with shaggy hair;Roman, Imperial period, 1st or 2nd century AD;Copy or variant of a Greek statue of the 3rd or 2nd centuries BC;;Accession # 42.201.7;;The figure is shown in a spiralling upward movement, perhaps in dance or in blowing on an instrument.

In his massive fist the god holds a was-scepter, signifying dominion, and in his missing right hand he would have held the ankh hieroglyph, meaning life.;Though attributes or an inscription that would identify this god are missing, the statue was almost certainly one of the series of divine statues erected by Amenhotep III in his vast mortuary temple in western Thebes. These represented the congregation of the Egyptian gods in attendance at the king's 30 year festival, or heb-sed. The site of this temple is identified by the colossi of Memnon, two monumental seated statues representing the king which stood in front of the entrance pylon of the temple.;;Amenhotep III celebrated three Heb-seds and constructed a palace city for this purpose at the site of Malqata, a mile or so south of his mortuary temple.

During the reign of his son, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604562 B.C.), the Neo-Babylonian empire reached its peak. This was largely attributable to Nebuchadnezzar's ability as a statesman and general. He maintained friendly relations with the Medes in the east while vying successfully with Egypt for control of trade on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He is well known as the biblical conqueror who deported the Jews to Babylon after the capture of Jerusalem.;During this period, Babylon became the city of splendor described by Herodotus and the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Because stone is rare in southern Mesopotamia, molded glazed bricks were used for building, transforming Babylon into a city of brilliant color. Relief figures in white, black, blue, red, and yellow decorated the city's gates and buildings.;The most important street in Babylon was the Processional Way, leading from the inner city through the Ishtar Gate to the Bit Akitu, or &quot;House of the New Year's Festival.&quot; The Ishtar Gate, built by Nebuchadnezzar II, was a glazed-brick structure decorated with figures of bulls and dragons, symbols of Adad, the weather god, and Marduk. North of the gate the roadway was lined with glazed figures of striding lions. This relief of a lion, the animal associated with Ishtar, goddess of love and war, served to protect the street; its repeated design served as a guide for the ritual processions from the city to the temple. addl Two Panels with striding lions Date: ca. 604–562 B.C.

Pairs of lamassieither human-headed winged bulls or lionsprotected and supported important doorways in Assyrian palaces. The horned headdress attests to their divinity, and the belt signifies their power. Assyrian sculptors gave these guardian figures five legs so that the animal stands firmly in place when viewed from the front, but appears to stride forward when seen from the side. The Standard Inscription of Ashurnasirpal II is incised in the area between the legs of the figure. ;;;;;Genesis 10:11;Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,;Genesis 10:12;And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.;;;;;(Sir Austen Henry Layard 1849, vol. I: 67-8) This gigantic head, blanched with age, thus rising from the bowels of the earth, might well have belonged to one of those fearful beings which are pictured in the traditions of the country, as appearing to mortals slowly ascending from the regions below.;But Abd-ur-Rahman convinced them that it was an antediluvian idol and had been one of, those infidel giants of whom the Prophetpeace be with him!has said that they were higher than the tallest date tree; this is one of the idols which Noahpeace be with him!cursed before the flood!;;;;;(Sir Austen Henry Layard, March 1847) The men being ready, and all my preparations complete, I stationed myself on top of the high bank of earth over the second bull, and ordered the wedges to he struck out from under the sculpture to he moved. Still, however, it remained firmly in its place. A rope having been passed around it, six or seven men easily tilted it over. The thick, ill-made cable stretched with the strain, and almost buried itself in the earth round which it was coiled. The ropes held well. The mass descended gradually, the Chaldaeans propping it up with the beams. It was a moment of great anxiety. The drums and shrill pipes of the Kurdish musicians increased the din and confusion caused by the war-cry of the Arabs, who were half frantic with excitement. They had thrown off nearly all their garments; their long hair floated in the wind; and they indulged in the wildest postures and gesticulations as they clung to the ropes. The women had congregated on the sides of the trenches, and by their incessant screams, and by the ear-piercing tahlehl, added to the enthusiasm of the men.;The bull once in motion, it was no longer possible to obtain a bearing. The loudest cries could produce were lost in the crash of discordant sounds. Neither the hippopotamus-hide whips of the Cawasses, nor the bricks and clods of earth with which I endeavoured to draw attention from some of the most noisy of the group, were of any avail. Away went the bull, steady enough as long as supported by the props behind; but as it came nearer to the rollers. The beams could no longer he used. The cable and ropes stretched more and more. Dry from the climate, as they felt the strain, they creaked and threw out dust. Water was thrown over them, but in vain, for they all broke together when the sculpture was within four or five feet of the rollers. The bull was precipitated to the ground. Those who held the ropes' thus suddenly released, followed its example, and were rolling, one over the other, in the dust. A sudden silence succeeded to the clamour. I rushed into the trenches, prepared to find the bull in many pieces.

I saw art today.;;If you were to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art or visited the Cloisters today it would have been your last chance to take home a tin memento of art. The loss of this icon, like the once beloved New York City subway token, will be all forgotten soon enough, but for now, a tribute is due.;;All over Manhattan Island this small piece of tin could be seen on people who had forgotten to take it off. Most of the ones I still own have been washed and dried. Sometimes it was people in need of a status symbol. Tourist, unaware that the color changed each day, could often be seen coming out of their hotels in the morning, fresh shirt with old button attached. Ive even seen those buttons set off metal detectors at Kennedy Airport. ;;For New Yorkers, once outside of the museum it always seemed to have a &quot;Met Museum gang members showing their colors&quot; flavor to it. If that little button was not discarded it would often become a nice little conversation piece. ;;Whatever reason people might have had for not leaving the little icon in the recycle bin when exiting, I always knew that that if that button could be found somewhere in my cloths hamper or lying in a heap besides my bed, there was going to be nice colorful dreams that night. Its all over now.","Eddie C3: metropolitanmuseumofart,Eddie C3: metropolitanmuseum,Eddie C3: art,Eddie C3: museums,Description,Observation,Non_Art,non_art,Artwork,3D,Art2or3","Non_Art"
