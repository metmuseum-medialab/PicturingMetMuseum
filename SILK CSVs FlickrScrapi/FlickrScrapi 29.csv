(57.8 x 94.6 cm);;On October 16, 1794, Washington called upon the militia at Fort Cumberland, Maryland, to suppress a rebellion in western Pennsylvania. The conflict was precipitated by the 1792 excise laws regarding the sale of distilled spirits. The Scottish-Irish immigrants who made their living from the sale and barter of whisky demmed the laws discriminatory and their protests turned into full-scale riots. Upon Washington's arrival to review his troops, the resistance vanished. The episode went down in history as one of the crucial early tests of central government and as a reminder of Washington's power.;;Gift of Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, 1963 ;;**;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world. It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.;;In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967. The interior was designated in 1977. ;;National Historic Register #86003556","wallyg: art,wallyg: painting,wallyg: washingtonreviewingthewesternarmyatfortcumberlandmaryland,wallyg: frederickkemmelmeyer,wallyg: fortcumberland,wallyg: metropolitanmuseumofart,wallyg: metropolitanmuseum,wallyg: museum,wallyg: nyc,wallyg: gothamist,wallyg: newyorkcity,wallyg: manhattan,wallyg: landmark,wallyg: artmuseum,wallyg: museummile,wallyg: themet,wallyg: ues,wallyg: uppereastside,wallyg: nyclpc,wallyg: newyorkcitylandmarkspreservationcommission,wallyg: ny,wallyg: georgewashington,wallyg: revolutionarywarhero,wallyg: foundingfather,wallyg: foundingfathers,wallyg: americanrevolution,wallyg: president,wallyg: patriot,wallyg: 1776,wallyg: revolutionarywar,wallyg: nationalregisterofhistoricplaces,wallyg: nrhp,wallyg: usnationalregisterofhistoricplaces,wallyg: nationalhistoriclandmark,wallyg: nhl,wallyg: usnationalhistoriclandmark,wallyg: washingtonreviewingthewesternarmyatfortcumberlandmarylan,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 29","2324096403.jpg","16.69","The Arrival in Bethlehem in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2007","ElissaSCA","The Arrival in Bethlehem, ca. 1540;Attributed to Master LC (Netherlandish, active second quarter 16th century);Oil on wood; 26 1/2 x 36 7/8 in.

(99.7 x 149.9 cm);Bequest of Stephen C. Clark, 1960 (61.101.17);;Circus Sideshow (or Parade de Cirque) is one of six major figure paintings that Seurat produced during his short career. More compact than his other mural-size compositions, and more mysterious in its allure, Seurat's first nocturnal painting debuted at the 1888 Salon des Independants in Paris. On a balustraded stage, under the misty glow of nine twinkling gaslights, a ringmaster (at right) and musicians (at left) play to a crowd of potential ticket buyers, whose assorted hats add a wry and rhythmic note to the foreground.;;Seurat made on-site sketches in the spring of 1887, when Fernand Corvi's traveling circus was set up in a working-class district of Paris, near the place de la Nation; he then developed the composition through several preparatory studies. Circus Sideshow represents the first important painting Seurat devoted to a scene of popular entertainment. In effect, it sets the stage for his last great figure compositions, La Chahut of 188990 (Kroller-Muller Museum, Otterlo) and Circus of 189091 (Musee d'Orsay, Paris).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/61.101.17 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/61.101.17</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: seurat,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: pointilism,ElissaSCA: neoimpressionism,ElissaSCA: postimpressionism,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 29","4564579059.jpg","2003.20.9","Hyacinthe-Eugene Meunier by Renoir in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2008","ElissaSCA","Artist: Auguste Renoir (French, 18411919);;Title: Eugene Murer (Hyacinthe-Eugene Meunier, 18411906);;Date: 1877;;Medium: Oil on canvas;;Dimensions: 18 1/2 x 15 1/2 in.
