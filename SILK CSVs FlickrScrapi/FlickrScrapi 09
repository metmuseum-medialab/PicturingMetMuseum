His first attempt, in 1864, was rejected on the grounds of indecency; however two years later, his &quot;Woman with a Parrot&quot; was accepted for the Salon of 1866. ;;While aspects of &quot;Woman with a Parrot&quot;notably, the figure's pose and subtly modeled flesh tonesaligned it with academic art, viewers were shocked by the presence of the model's discarded clothing and disheveled hair.

Weber, 1992 (1992.165.20ab);;This mortuary vessel, known as a hu, is decorated with the animated drama of a blue beast with bared fangs lunging at a mounted archer. Roaming the other side of the hu is a long, striding tiger. Executed with brilliant pigments and confident black brushstrokes, the decoration on this vessel perfectly expresses the boldly assertive character of the Western Han dynasty and is, moreover, one of the finest known examples of Han painting.;;The iconography of the decor is celestial: the blue beast represents the star Sirius, known in China as the Heavenly Wolf, and the archer is a personification of the adjoining constellation, Bow, whose arrow always points directly at the Wolf star. Their companion on the other side is the White Tiger, consmological symbol of the West, whose domain in the night sky borders that of the Wolf and Bow.;;The Wolf is a baleful star. He governs thievery and looting and represents the &quot;barbarian&quot; Xiongnu tribes that warred with the Han people on the northwestern borders of China. It is said that when the twinklings of the Wolf star change color, banditry will curse the land; when the star shifts from its normal position, the Xiongnu will be on the warpath. Fortunately, there is the vigilant Bow, who &quot;punishes rebels and knows those who are crafty and evil.&quot; Forever pointed at the Wolf, across whose body is an array of ill-boding meteors, the Bow was considered the protector of China. Interestingly, the mounted archer, the eternal image of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes, is shown hunting the symbolic representation of the Xiongnu.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.165.20ab rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.165.20ab</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: jar,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,Art2or3,3D,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 09","6159944536.jpg","1986.319.22","The Death of Lucretia Roundel by Moderno in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2011","ElissaSCA","Title: The Death of Lucretia;;Object Name: Plaquette;;Artist: Galeazzo Mondella, called Moderno (Italian, 14671528);;Culture: Italian;;Date: early 16th century;;Medium: Bronze;;Dimensions: D. 2 in.

They were undoubtedly produced by one of the leading Roman workshops that supplied the imperial family as well as affluent, cultured, private individuals - the same clientele for whom the villas around Rome and Naples were built, decorated, and furnished. They are decorated in high relief with figures of cupids and partially gilt. The cupids, several of whom are shown dancing and playing instruments, may be associated with Dionysiac festivities and are thus eminently suitable on vessels meant for a drinking party. But the figures have little, if any, real symbolism here and were chosen simply because they formed an attractive group. Like many other pieces of ornate silverware, these cups were clearly intended as much for display as for use. ; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;item=1994.43.1,+.2&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;ite...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: city,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: silver,ElissaSCA: cup,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,Art2or3,3D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 09","6766200985.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Woman Inthemirror","NA","Woman Inthemirror: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Woman Inthemirror: art,Woman Inthemirror: ny,Woman Inthemirror: nyc,Woman Inthemirror: newyork,Woman Inthemirror: met,Art2or3,3D,furniture,Artwork","Furniture""SET 09","6766147583.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Woman Inthemirror","NA","Woman Inthemirror: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Woman Inthemirror: art,Woman Inthemirror: ny,Woman Inthemirror: nyc,Woman Inthemirror: newyork,Woman Inthemirror: met,Art2or3,3D,Artwork,costume_textile","-""SET 09","6766154157.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Woman Inthemirror","NA","Woman Inthemirror: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Woman Inthemirror: art,Woman Inthemirror: ny,Woman Inthemirror: nyc,Woman Inthemirror: newyork,Woman Inthemirror: met,Woman Inthemirror: opal,Woman Inthemirror: opals,Woman Inthemirror: jewelry,Woman Inthemirror: jewel,Woman Inthemirror: opale,Art2or3,3D,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 09","2180739973.jpg","17.190.1656","Byzantine Gold Necklace with Pendants in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oct. 2007","ElissaSCA","Gold Necklace with Pendants;Byzantine;Made 600-700;;Accession # 17.190.1656;;The intricately worked pendants are separated by hexagonal spacers.;;Text abridged from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: necklace,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 09","2180739975.jpg","2006.569","Byantine Gold Cross Pendant in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oct. 2007","ElissaSCA","Gold Cross Pendant;Byzantine;Made 500-700;;Accession # 2006.569;;A wealthy private person or a member of the clergy may have worn this elegant cross, the largest known to have been worked in opus interrasile.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: cross,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 09","2183538432.jpg","55.135.5, 55.135.8, 55.135.7, 55.135.9, 55.135.6","Display of Rock Crystal Objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oct. 2007","ElissaSCA","Five rock crystal works found in a cistern in Carthage (now in Tunisia, North Africa) demonstrate the quality of the arts of that great city as the Roman world became Byzantine.

(51 cm);Purchase, Barbara and William Karatz Gift, 2002 (2002.501);;This figurine of a foreigner advertises the cosmopolitan and international spirit of the deceased occupant in the tomb that it furnished. Foreigners were frequently depicted in tomb paintings and sculptures, and imported music, textiles, metalware, and fashions were enthusiastically consumed by the Tang elite. During the seventh century, the Tang conquered, among others, the Eastern Turks in present-day Mongolia and the Western Turks in present-day Xinjiang. International trade was vigorous during the Tang and many people from distant lands lived in China.;;The metal substructure supporting this figure is heavier than that in most Tang funerary sculptures. Though it is not known precisely what type of person this represents, attention has been given to the features that would set this man apart from the Chinese. He has an exaggerated brow, high, broad cheekbones, and thick strands of hair, combed in rows. The adornments hanging from his belt, as well as other features of his dress are distinct from traditional Chinese clothing. His triangular collar is similar to that worn by one of the foreign dignitaries depicted in 706 in a wall painting from the tomb of Li Xian, Crown Prince Zhanghuai, while his knee-length skirt, belted at the waist, and tall leather boots were typical of Central Asian dress. These, coupled with his lack of outer jacket and the position of his clasped and raised hands, suggest that this attendant was holding the reigns to another figurine, one that was a valuable Central Asian commodity: a horse.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mgqi/ho_2002.501.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mgqi/ho_2002.501.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,Art2or3,3D,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 09","4328577602.jpg","2000.349.4","Man with Asiatic Features in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2009","ElissaSCA","Man with Asiatic Features;Tang dynasty (618-907), 7th century;Earthenware with pigment;;Accession # 2000.349.4;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 09","4328577608.jpg","2000.349.4","Detail of a Man with Asiatic Features in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2009","ElissaSCA","Man with Asiatic Features;Tang dynasty (618-907), 7th century;Earthenware with pigment;;Accession # 2000.349.4;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 09","6339460376.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

One important symbolic aspect was based on the understanding of the temple as an image of the natural world as the Egyptians knew it. Lining the temple base are carvings of papyrus and lotus plants that seem to grow from water, symbolized by figures of the Nile god Hapy. The two columns on the porch rise toward the sky like tall bundles of papyrus stalks with lotus blossoms bound with them. Above the gate and temple entrance are images of the sun disk flanked by the outspread wings of Horus, the sky god. The sky is also represented by the vultures, wings outspread, that appear on the ceiling of the entrance porch.;;On the outer walls between earth and sky are carved scenes of the king making offerings to deities, who hold scepters and the symbol of life. The figures are carved in sunk relief. In the brilliant Egyptian sunlight, shadows cast along the figures' edges would have emphasized their outlines. Isis, Osiris, their son Horus, and the other deities are identified by their crowns and the inscriptions beside their figures. These scenes are repeated in two horizontal registers. The king is identified by his regalia and by his names, which appear close to his head in elongated oval shapes called cartouches; many of the cartouches simply read &quot;pharaoh.&quot; This king was actually Caesar Augustus of Rome, who, as ruler of Egypt, had himself depicted in the traditional regalia of the pharaoh. Augustus had many temples erected in Egyptian style, honoring Egyptian deities. This small temple, built about 15 B.C.E., honored the goddess Isis and, beside her, Pedesi and Pihor, deified sons of a local Nubian chieftain.;;In the first room of the temple, reliefs again show the &quot;pharaoh&quot; praying and offering to the gods, but the relief here is raised from the background so that the figures can be seen easily in the more indirect light. From this room one can look into the temple past the middle room used for offering ceremonies and into the sanctuary of the goddess Isis. The only carvings in these two rooms are around the door frame leading into the sanctuary and on the back wall of the sanctuary, where a relief depicts Pihor worshiping Isis, and below partly destroyed Pedesi worshiping Osiris.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/the_temple_of_dendur/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100004628 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: temple,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: augustus,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: portrait,Art2or3,3D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","4718328320.jpg","-","great face","Kazoomdaboom","NA","Kazoomdaboom: usadec09,usa dec09,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","5381646315.jpg","11.139","Mummy with Inserted Panel Portrait of a Youth","IslesPunkFan","AD 80-100;From Hawara;;Photo taken on a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on 3/5/10.  addl Mummy with an Inserted Panel Portrait of a Youth Date: A.D. 80–100 Medium: Encaustic on limewood, linen, human remains Accession Number: 11.139 On view in Gallery 137","IslesPunkFan: met,IslesPunkFan: metropolitanmuseum,IslesPunkFan: metropolitanmuseumofart,IslesPunkFan: art,IslesPunkFan: history,IslesPunkFan: museum,IslesPunkFan: ny,IslesPunkFan: nyc,IslesPunkFan: newyork,IslesPunkFan: manhattan,IslesPunkFan: egypt,IslesPunkFan: egyptian,Art2or3,3D,Description,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","5788457023.jpg","96.18.174","Etruscan Terracotta Head of a Woman in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Terracotta head of a woman;;Period: Late Classical;;Date: 4th century B.C. ;;Culture: Etruscan ;;Medium: Terracotta ;;Dimensions: 6 5/16 x 4 1/2 x 3 3/4 in.

The thorough integration of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Cypriot stylistic elements on the Amathus sarcophagus is characteristic of Cypriot art and culture during the fifth century B.C.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","1737273887.jpg","62.240.1","Statue of St. Matthew in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Saint Matthew;Polychromed and gilt wood;South German, mid-18th century;;Accession # 62.240.1;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: catchycolors,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: saint,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","1737273909.jpg","62.240.1","Statue of St. Matthew in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Saint Matthew;Polychromed and gilt wood;South German, mid-18th century;;Accession # 62.240.1;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: catchycolors,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: saint,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","1737273937.jpg","62.240.2","Statue of Saint Mark in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Saint Mark;Polychromed and gilt wood;South German, mid-18th century;;Accession # 62.240.2;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: saint,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","1737273963.jpg","62.240.2","Statue of Saint Mark in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Saint Mark;Polychromed and gilt wood;South German, mid-18th century;;Accession # 62.240.2;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: saint,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 09","2183538436.jpg","62.10.4","Vessel in the Shape of a Fish in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oct. 2007","ElissaSCA","Vessel in the Shape of a Fish;Copper alloy;Roman or Byzantine;Made 300-600;;Accession # 62.10.4;;The stopper has a butterfly on th end as if the fish were feeding.

The identification of the head as that of Marcus Agrippa appears to be confirmed by an inscribed stone base that was also discovered. ;;Agrippa was one of Augustus closest friends and supporters, who played a role in the civil wars during the 30s BC. ;;Thereafter, he acted almost as second-in-command to the emperor and as his roving ambassador, dealing with troubles in various parts of the Empire.
