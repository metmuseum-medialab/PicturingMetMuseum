Some of the most important wall paintings surviving from antiquity come from a Roman villa at Boscoreale built shortly after the middle of the first century B.C. The villa, which was buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D., is referred to as the Villa of P. Fannius Synistor, one of its owners during the first half part of the first century A.D. Excavated in the early 1900s, the villa's frescoes are among the most important to be found anywhere in the Roman world.;;The surviving paintings are extremely fine examples of the late Second Style, the most renowned style in Roman wall painting. Throughout the frescoes from the villa at Boscoreale there are visual ambiguities to tease the eye, including architectural details painted to resemble real ones, such as rusticated masonry, pillars, and columns that cast shadows into the viewer's space, and more conventional trompe l'oeil devices, such as three-dimensional meanders. Objects of daily life were depicted in such a way as to seem real, with metal and glass vases on shelves and tables appearing to project out from the wall. Cumulatively, these trompe l'oeil devices reveal the Republican owner's evident pleasure in impressing guests at his comfortable summer retreat.;;Department of Greek and Roman Art. &quot;Boscoreale: Frescoes from the Villa of P.

(94 x 63.5 cm);Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, 1992 (1992.146);;The German painter and printmaker Otto Dix worked in a variety of styles, from Expressionism to Dada, but his most celebrated mode was the deadpan, matter-of-fact realism known as Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) as seen in The Businessman Max Roesberg. Dix was a leader of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement, which reacted against all that was personal and spiritual in Expressionism while still maintaining many Expressionistic techniques. Dix and other artists of this movement, such as George Grosz and Christian Schad, turned to a hyper-realistic treatment of contemporary themes that was influenced by the work of German old masters. Their work depicts people and places with such clinical objectivity that their pictures allow us to reconstruct the fashions, coiffures, interior furnishings, and social life of Germany during the 1920s and 1930s.;;The Businessman Max Roesberg is an excellent example of the celebrated portraits Dix painted in Dresden, Dusseldorf, and Berlin between 1921 and 1927. With just a few poignant details, he was able to capture the individuality of his sitters, who included prominent lawyers, businessmen, and art dealers as well as poets, prostitutes, and performers.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwcm/ho_1992.146.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwcm/ho_1992.146.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: german,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 31","4129104786.jpg","51.112.3","L'Arlesienne by Van Gogh in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2008","ElissaSCA","L'Arlesienne: Madame Joseph-Michel Ginoux (nee Marie Julien, 18481911), 188889;Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 18531890);Oil on canvas ;36 x 29 in. (91.4 x 73.7 cm);Bequest of Sam A. Lewisohn, 1951 (51.112.3);;Marie Ginoux was the proprietress of the Cafe de la Gare, where Van Gogh lived in Arles between May and September 1888, before he moved into the nearby Yellow House. In early November, wearing the regional costume of the legendary dark-haired beauties of Arles, she posed for both Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh was thrilled to &quot;have an Arlesienne at last&quot; and quickly &quot;slashed on in an hour&quot; his first, more summarily executed version of this portrait (Musee d'Orsay, Paris), using the thick jute canvas that Gauguin had brought with him to Arles.

Young Mada's portrait was executed in 1912. A series of preliminary pencil sketches, now in public and private collections, show that as the composition evolved, the artist experimented with alternative poses and background motifs. Ultimately, he selected an open, painterly treatment that contrasts with the highly stylized designs adapted for the backgrounds of his fin-de-siecle portraits.

Bonnard and his friend Edouard Vuillard also adapted the lyrical elements of a Renoiresque impressionism and Pointillism to their quiet everyday scenes which have come to be termed intimist. These influences remain evident in The Terrace at Vernon, which he began in 1920 and reworked in 1939. This painting of his house in the Seine Valley reveals an intricate spatial organization. Bonnard differentiates the foreground space from the background by the dramatic vertical of the huge tree trunk. On the right he frames pockets of space around the figures.

His flamboyance, flair for drama and self-promotion, and hyperactive imagination reinvigorated the movement and its public popularity. Dali, who was given to hallucinations and paranoiac visions, cultivated these outrageous subjects for his paintings, rendering them so meticulously that they were unsettling in their clinical matter-of-factness. Such pictures exemplified the Surrealist preoccupation with dreams and the unconscious.;;;Painted in the summer of 1929, &quot;The Accommodations of Desire&quot; is a small gem that deals with Dali's sexual anxieties over a love affair with an older, married woman. The woman, Gala, then the wife of the Surrealist poet Paul Eluard, became Dali's life-long muse and mate. In this picture, which Dali painted after taking a walk alone with Gala, he included seven enlarged pebbles on which he envisioned what lay ahead for him: &quot;terrorizing&quot; lions' heads (not so &quot;accommodating&quot; to his &quot;desires&quot; as the title of the painting facetiously suggests), as well as a toupee and a colony of ants (a symbol of decay). Also depicted are various vessels (one in the shape of a woman's head) and three figures embracing on a platform. Dali did not paint the lion heads but, rather, cut them out from what must have been an illustrated children's book, slyly matching the latter's detailed style with his own. These collaged elements are virtually indistinguishable from the super-saturated color and painstaking realism of the rest of the composition, startling the viewer into questioning the existence of the phenomena recorded and of the representation as a whole.","Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: accommodations,Maulleigh: salvador,Maulleigh: dali,Maulleigh: 1929,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,AccessionInDesc,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 31","4295401185.jpg","14.40.619","Lucas van Uffel (died 1637)","Maulleigh","Anthony van Dyck (Flemish, 15991641);Title Lucas van Uffel (died 1637);Date ca. 162127;Medium Oil on canvas;Dimensions 49 x 39 5/8 in.

Six belong to the Metropolitan Museum while three are in the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia. The group was discovered in 1902 in Karavas (northern Cyprus) sealed with a hoard of jewelry and gold, much of which is also now in the Metroplitan's collection. Originally the smaller plates were arranged around the largest, the one shown here depicting David's combat with Goliath. On the backs of all the plates are the control stamps of the emperor Heraclius, who may have commissioned them to celebrate his victory over the Persians in 62829, which resulted in the recapture of Jerusalem. During the war, it is said that Heraclius fought the Persian general Razatis in single-handed combat, an event that is perhaps evoked in the depiction of David's defeat of Goliath. Imperial imagery is present also on other plates, where ceremonial scenes from the biblical king's life are set before the arcade of a palace. Their style is a conscious reference to classical art.

While this particular chair was not pictured in the photo album, its fine quality and its relationship to the other furniture shown in the house suggest that it may be Herter's work.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/revi/ho_1986.204.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/revi/ho_1986.204.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: furniture,ElissaSCA: chair,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: wood,3D,Art2or3,furniture,Artwork","Furniture""SET 31","4016336062.jpg","16.154.5","Araballo with the Arms of the Hospital of Santa Maria Della Scala in Siena in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2008","ElissaSCA","Araballo with the Arms of the Hospital of Santa Maria Della Scala in Siena;Majolica;Italian, Tuscany, 1425-1450;;Accession # 16.154.5;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: majolica,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: renaissance,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 31","4016336064.jpg","46.85.5","Majolica Jar in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2008","ElissaSCA","Jar;Majolica;Italian, Tuscany, early 15th century;;Accession # 46.85.5;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: majolica,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: renaissance,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 31","4130896805.jpg","-","Metropolitan Museum of Art, observation","Le Xuan-Cung","New York City - USA;;seen in :;<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/le_xuan-cung/sets/72157622869004930>New York (part III)</a>;<a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/le_xuan-cung/ rel=nofollow>recent</a>;<a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/le_xuan-cung/friends/ rel=nofollow>contacts images</a>;","NA,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 31","4132026212.jpg","-","Metropolitan Museum of Art, observation","Le Xuan-Cung","New York City - USA;;seen in :;<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/le_xuan-cung/sets/72157622869004930>New York (part III)</a>;<a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/le_xuan-cung/ rel=nofollow>recent</a>;<a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/le_xuan-cung/friends/ rel=nofollow>contacts images</a>;","NA,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 31","4151739560.jpg","-","EmptyBenches_TheMET(164)","rverc","Gallery 823 - The Annenberg Collection: Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Masters;;Part of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art;<a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/galleries/ncmc/823 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/collections/galleries/ncmc/823</a>","rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: europeanpaintings,rverc: bench164,rverc: eugeneboudin,rverc: pablopicasso,rverc: paulgauguin,rverc: camillecorot,rverc: toulouselautrec,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 31","4175764718.jpg","-","Pendant in the Form of a Parrot","rosewithoutathorn84","Baroque pearls with enameled gold mount;Probably Spanish, late 16th or early 17th century","rosewithoutathorn84: met,rosewithoutathorn84: metropolitanmuseumofart,rosewithoutathorn84: newyorkcity,rosewithoutathorn84: newyork,rosewithoutathorn84: ny,rosewithoutathorn84: nyc,rosewithoutathorn84: art,rosewithoutathorn84: history,rosewithoutathorn84: painting,rosewithoutathorn84: sculpture,3D,Art2or3,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 31","4165354753.jpg","-","Metropolitan","channel one","NA","channel one: newyork,channel one: usa,channel one: metropolitan,channel one: urban,channel one: museum,channel one: screen,Art2or3,painting,Artwork,2D","Painting""SET 31","4207050213.jpg","-","DSC_0197","yyheidi","NA","NA,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 31","4207811456.jpg","-","DSC_0214","yyheidi","NA","NA,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 31","4207053097.jpg","-","DSC_0274","yyheidi","NA","NA,3D,Art2or3,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 31","4216208338.jpg","-","Knight Sky","Dr DAD (Daniel A D'Auria MD)","Composite photograph.

The shafts also occur in funerary contexts.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: stele,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: hathor,ElissaSCA: goddess,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 31","1526217577.jpg","74.51.2466","Limestone Priest in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Statue of a priest, end of 6th century B.C.; Archaic;Cypriot; Said to be from west of the temple at Golgoi;Limestone; H.

Originally the smaller plates were arranged around the largest, the one shown here depicting David's combat with Goliath. On the backs of all the plates are the control stamps of the emperor Heraclius, who may have commissioned them to celebrate his victory over the Persians in 62829, which resulted in the recapture of Jerusalem. During the war, it is said that Heraclius fought the Persian general Razatis in single-handed combat, an event that is perhaps evoked in the depiction of David's defeat of Goliath. Imperial imagery is present also on other plates, where ceremonial scenes from the biblical king's life are set before the arcade of a palace. Their style is a conscious reference to classical art.

The desire for an afterlife through which worldly pleasures and activities are maintained is reflected in the placing of models (known as spirit goods, or &quot;mingqi&quot;) of attendants, entertainers, pets, domestic animals, and a host of worldly goods in Chinese tombs, particularly during the first millennium. Tomb furnishings reflected the wealth, status, and interests of the deceased, while equipping tombs with such items was often understood as an act of homage by the deceased's family and descendants.

An alcove recessed in the ceiling above transforms into architecture the parsol or canopy that sheltered persons of high estate. Hanging ornaments refer to floral garlands worn by the elite and bestowed in veneration on sacred images.;;This altar--a railed rectangular wooden platform backed by a planked wall between two pillars--represents a Japanese style of Buddhist architecture. It is a replica of the altar at a twelth century Amida Hall at Fuki-ji in K yushi built in 1986 using traditional material and techniques by the Kyoto firm Yasui Kamokuten, under the direction of architectural historian Kakichi Suzuki. At its center is the golden image of Dainichi Nyori, the supreme Buddha of the cosmos in esoteric Buddhist thought. He is the source from whom all other deities and everything in the universe emanate, as light does from the sun. His hands form the mystic gesture (mudra) of perfect knowledge, which holds the powe to restrain passions that hinder enlightenment. With the left index finger surrounded and protected by the fingers of the right, this gesture expresses the all-encompassing union of the spiritual and material realms of being. At one time the sculpture also had a crown over the topknot adorned with images of five Buddhas, representing Dainchi's five forms. In keeping with the occult nature of this image, mystery and introspection suffuse its features. Graceful proportions made possible by a new technique of carving and assembling sculpture in sections are characteristic of images of the later Heain period, when courtly aesthetics were paramount. In the glow of its original gold-leaf covering, this Dainichi must have appeared to embody his name, the Buddha of the Great Raddiance of Illumination.;;Standing sentinel at the corners of the platform are two armored figures of menacing mien. They are from a set of the Guarrdian Kings of the Four Directions, Hindu demigods who were absorbed into the Buddhist pantheon as protectors of the teaching. Their stocky figures retain the massive strength of an early Heian style and were carved from single blocks of wood. Only the arms, now missing, were carved separately.;;**;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.

One important symbolic aspect was based on the understanding of the temple as an image of the natural world as the Egyptians knew it. Lining the temple base are carvings of papyrus and lotus plants that seem to grow from water, symbolized by figures of the Nile god Hapy. The two columns on the porch rise toward the sky like tall bundles of papyrus stalks with lotus blossoms bound with them. Above the gate and temple entrance are images of the sun disk flanked by the outspread wings of Horus, the sky god. The sky is also represented by the vultures, wings outspread, that appear on the ceiling of the entrance porch.;;On the outer walls between earth and sky are carved scenes of the king making offerings to deities, who hold scepters and the symbol of life. The figures are carved in sunk relief. In the brilliant Egyptian sunlight, shadows cast along the figures' edges would have emphasized their outlines. Isis, Osiris, their son Horus, and the other deities are identified by their crowns and the inscriptions beside their figures. These scenes are repeated in two horizontal registers. The king is identified by his regalia and by his names, which appear close to his head in elongated oval shapes called cartouches; many of the cartouches simply read &quot;pharaoh.&quot; This king was actually Caesar Augustus of Rome, who, as ruler of Egypt, had himself depicted in the traditional regalia of the pharaoh. Augustus had many temples erected in Egyptian style, honoring Egyptian deities.

One important symbolic aspect was based on the understanding of the temple as an image of the natural world as the Egyptians knew it. Lining the temple base are carvings of papyrus and lotus plants that seem to grow from water, symbolized by figures of the Nile god Hapy. The two columns on the porch rise toward the sky like tall bundles of papyrus stalks with lotus blossoms bound with them. Above the gate and temple entrance are images of the sun disk flanked by the outspread wings of Horus, the sky god. The sky is also represented by the vultures, wings outspread, that appear on the ceiling of the entrance porch.;;On the outer walls between earth and sky are carved scenes of the king making offerings to deities, who hold scepters and the symbol of life. The figures are carved in sunk relief. In the brilliant Egyptian sunlight, shadows cast along the figures' edges would have emphasized their outlines. Isis, Osiris, their son Horus, and the other deities are identified by their crowns and the inscriptions beside their figures. These scenes are repeated in two horizontal registers. The king is identified by his regalia and by his names, which appear close to his head in elongated oval shapes called cartouches; many of the cartouches simply read &quot;pharaoh.&quot; This king was actually Caesar Augustus of Rome, who, as ruler of Egypt, had himself depicted in the traditional regalia of the pharaoh. Augustus had many temples erected in Egyptian style, honoring Egyptian deities. This small temple, built about 15 B.C.E., honored the goddess Isis and, beside her, Pedesi and Pihor, deified sons of a local Nubian chieftain.;;In the first room of the temple, reliefs again show the &quot;pharaoh&quot; praying and offering to the gods, but the relief here is raised from the background so that the figures can be seen easily in the more indirect light. From this room one can look into the temple past the middle room used for offering ceremonies and into the sanctuary of the goddess Isis.

She may be dressed for a festival and the birds and basket of fruit she carries might be offerings. Her garment has slipped off her shoulder, a detail often seen in representations of old women that hints at the liberation of the elderly from the restrictions imposed on women of childbearing years. As in many such figures, direct observation of reality lends force to deeper religious implications. The piece may be a copy of an older, Hellenistic model or a creation of the Roman period in a tradition that was still alive.

(23.8 x 12.7 x 8.3 cm);The Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Collection, Gift of Nelson A. Rockefeller, 1972 (1978.412.323);;This ivory pendant mask is one of a pair of nearly identical works; its counterpart is in the British Museum in London. Although images of women are rare in Benin's courtly tradition, these two works have come to symbolize the legacy of a dynasty that continues to the present day. The pendant mask is believed to have been produced in the early sixteenth century for the King or &quot;Oba&quot; Esigie, the king of Benin, to honor his mother, Idia. The Oba may have worn it at rites commemorating his mother, although today such pendants are worn at annual ceremonies of spiritual renewal and purification.;In Benin, ivory is related to the color white, a symbol of ritual purity that is associated with Olokun, god of the sea. As the source of extraordinary wealth and fertility, Olokun is the spiritual counterpart of the &quot;oba&quot;. Ivory is central to the constellation of symbols surrounding Olokun and the &quot;oba&quot;. Not only is it white, but it is itself Benin's principle commercial commodity and it helped attract the Portuguese traders who also brought wealth to Benin.;;The mask is a sensitive, idealized portrait, depicting its subject with softly modeled features, bearing inlaid metal and carved scarification marks on the forehead, and wearing bands of coral beads below the chin. In the openwork tiara and collar are carved stylized mudfish and the bearded faces of Portuguese. Because they live both on land and in the water, mudfish represent the king's dual nature as human and divine.
