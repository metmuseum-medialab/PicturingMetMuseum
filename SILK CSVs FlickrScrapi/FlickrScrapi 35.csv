He was elected Pope in 1740. The conclave which elected him had lasted six months; he is alleged to have said to the cardinals: &quot;If you wish to elect a saint, choose Gotti; a statesman, Aldrovandi; a donkey, elect me&quot; (in Italy the donkey symbolizes ignorance; it can also represent stubborn faithfulness). His Papacy began in a time of great difficulties, chiefly caused by the disputes between Catholic rulers and the Papacy about governmental demands to nominate bishops rather than leaving the appointment to the Church. He managed to overcome most of these problems the Holy See's disputes with the Kingdom of Naples, Sardinia, Spain, Venice, and Austria were settled.;;He had a very active papacy, reforming the education of priests, the calendar of feasts of the Church, and many papal institutions. Perhaps the most important act of Benedict XIV's pontificate was the promulgation of his famous laws about missions in the two bulls, Ex quo singulari and Omnium solicitudinum. In these bulls he ruled on the custom of accommodating Christian words and usages to express non-Christian ideas and practices of the native cultures, which had been extensively done by the Jesuits in their Indian and Chinese missions. An example of this is the statues of ancestors - there had long been uncertainty whether honor paid to one's ancestors was unacceptable 'ancestor worship,' or if it was something more like the Catholic veneration of the saints. This question was especially pressing in the case of an ancestor known not to have been a Christian. The choice of a Chinese translation for the name of God had also been debated since the early 17th century. Benedict XIV denounced these practices in these two bulls. The consequence of this was that many of these converts left the Church.</i>;;From Wikipedia","Maulleigh: pope,Maulleigh: benedict,Maulleigh: xiv,Maulleigh: pierre,Maulleigh: hubert,Maulleigh: subleyras,Maulleigh: pietro,Maulleigh: subleiras,Maulleigh: 1746,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: painting,Maulleigh: portrait,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 35","3614720723.jpg","-","The Reverend Philip Cocks (1735-1797)","Maulleigh","Johan Joseph Zoffany (German, 1733-1810);;Oil on Canvas;;The artist, born near Frankfurt and trained in Rome, moved to England in 1760.

The attribution of the picture has been much debated. Long ascribed to the Flemish painter Gaspar de Crayer (15841669), it has also been ascribed to the Madrid artist Juan Bautista Maino. Maino advised the king on artistic matters and participated in the decoration of the royal palace of the Buen Retiro, Madrid.

Completed in 1937, three years after the artist's first one-man exhibition, at age twenty-six, this majestic panorama is also his largest canvas and one of the few that depicts figures in a landscape. First exhibited in 1939 with the title Summer, it remains the only completed painting in a projected cycle of the four seasons.;;Executed in objective and exacting detail, the realistic figures and landscape seem at odds with the surrealistically contrived narrative. Seven figures are located on an imaginary plateau near the top of the Niederhorn, in the Bernese Oberland, a landscape familiar to Balthus since childhood. Either intentionally or unintentionally, the figures seem unaware of one another. Their gaze is trancelike, and one young woman is asleep on the ground. While the connection between the figures is ambiguous, there is a direct correspondence between the shape and posture of each person and the surrounding mountain formations.;;As a young man, Balthus made the obligatory trip to Italy and France to study the work of the old masters, including Piero della Francesca, Nicolas Poussin, and Gustave Courbet. In this masterwork of his early years, Balthus pays homage to the strong, simplified forms of Piero and the cultivated awkwardness of the figures of Courbet.","Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: mountain,Maulleigh: balthus,Maulleigh: painting,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 35","3687363971.jpg","-","Checking the museum map, Met, NYC","Uncle Lynx","In the background: Portrait of Elizabeth Farren (1790) by Thomas Lawrence.","Uncle Lynx: metropolitanmuseumofartmet,Uncle Lynx: manhattanisland,Uncle Lynx: nycny,Uncle Lynx: usa,Uncle Lynx: spring2009,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 35","3687605717.jpg","-","John Julius Angerstein (1732/351823)","Maulleigh","Sir Thomas Lawrence (English, 17691830);;Angerstein was a prominent financier and a founder of Lloyd's.

For this painting, which was included in the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, Sisley simply walked up the hill from his rented house and selected a northwest view overlooking the town. The building at left was located within the border of neighboring Louveciennes.

(254.6 x 360.7 cm);Gift of Junius S. Morgan, 1887 (87.16);;Sir Joshua Reynolds was England's most important Georgian artist. His style was formed while he was apprenticed to the portraitist Thomas Hudson (17011779), and during a stay of several years' duration in Italy, where he studied antique sculpture and pictures by the old masters. Returning to London in 1753, he became the city's busiest fashionable painter. In 1768, he was appointed first president of the Royal Academy; in 1784, principal painter to George III. Reynolds overcame an inadequate grasp of anatomy and perspective with impetuous handling, sonorous color, and a profound understanding of the rhetorical possibilities of pose and gesture.;;The conversation piece came into vogue in Britain in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. A conversation, as it was then called, was a portrait of relatives or friends, at home and at leisure, engaged, as here, in some convivial activity. The genre evolved from seventeenth-century Dutch and contemporary French genre paintings. Small &quot;conversations,&quot; featuring figures twelve to fifteen inches tall, were widely available for modest prices. The more popular artists moved to larger towns and eventually to London, where they painted portraits of various formats to the scale of life. Leaving royal group portraits aside, Thomas Fane, the younger son of the eighth earl of Westmoreland, is the principal subject of what seems to be the largest of conversation pieces, a vehicle for the display of the young Reynolds's exceptional talent.;;<i>Henry Fane, (4 May 1739 4 June 1802) MP for Lyme Regis 17721802.;;The younger son of Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland.

(74.9 x 109.9 cm);Hugo Kastor Fund, 1962 (62.95);;Edward Hopper's early training from 1900 to 1906 at the New York School of Art with Robert Henri, leader of The Eight, and his work as an illustrator between 1899 and 1924, led him to paint realistic scenes of urban and rural America. In 1924 a successful gallery exhibition in New York enabled him to give up commercial work altogether and concentrate full time on painting. Hopper depicted his favored subjects cityscapes, landscapes, and room interiors solemnly, in carefully composed compositions that seem timeless and frozen but are animated by the effects of natural and man-made light. As fellow painter Charles Burchfield wrote for the catalogue of the Museum of Modern Art's 1933 Hopper retrospective: &quot;Hopper's viewpoint is essentially classic; he presents his subjects without sentiment, propaganda, or theatrics. He is the pure painter, interested in his material for its own sake, and in the exploitation of his idea of form, color, and space division.&quot;;;In &quot;The Lighthouse at Two Lights&quot; Hopper isolated the dramatic silhouette of the 120-foot-high lighthouse tower and adjoining Coast Guard station against the open expanse of blue sky. Set on a rocky promontory in Cape Elizabeth, Maine though no water is visible in the painting the architecture is bathed in bright sunlight offset by dark shadows. Since 1914 Hopper had regularly summered in Maine, and this picture is one of three oils and several watercolors that he did of this site during summer 1929. To Hopper, the lighthouse at Two Lights symbolized the solitary individual stoically facing the onslaught of change in an industrial society. The integrity and clarity of his work made Hopper a quiet force in American art for forty years and one of America's most popular artists.","Maulleigh: edward,Maulleigh: hopper,Maulleigh: lighthouse,Maulleigh: two,Maulleigh: lights,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 35","3709775143.jpg","-","A Wooded Landscape with Cows and Goats, 1616","Maulleigh","Roelandt Savery (Flemish, 15761639);Oil on Wood;;Savery's family fled the troubled Spanish Netherlands about 1591, settling in Amsterdam.

Also rendered in exquisite detail are the princesse's sumptuous jewels, which include the fashionable antique-inspired pendant around her neck.;;The Princesse de Broglie died of consumption at the age of thirty-five.

Vastly admired on the Continent, where it was exhibited in Paris, Ghent, and Bordeaux, the painting was subsequently shown in England and the United States. It has become one of the Metropolitan Museums best-known works of art.;Bonheur began work on The Horse Fair in 1852.

Of local manufacture, these brightly colored vases were made exclusively for funerary purposes. Around the top of this vessel is a row of small lion heads in relief, painted yellow against a purple background. Below the lion heads is a band of Erotes and triglyphs. The foot of the vase is decorated with a row of acanthus leaves modeled in high relief and painted red, blue, pink, and yellow.;;As is characteristic of this type of vase from Centuripe, the figural scene is confined to the front of the vessel. It illustrates a wedding scene set against a rich rose-pink background. The bride wears a long purple chiton with a yellow himation drawn up over her head to serve as a veil. She is handed a folded purple cloth by the figure at right. At left are two attendants, one of whom wears an ivy wreath and plays a tympanon.;;This vase, like others in its class, was decorated in tempera after it was fired in the kiln so that a full range of colors could be achieved.

The appearance of these motifs attests to the continuing influence of Greek imagery associated with the wine god Dionysus. On this silver-gilt vessel, floral arches, supported by low pilasters, frame four dancing female figures. Each holds a ceremonial object in either hand: grape and leaf branches, a vessel, a heart-shaped flower. Beneath one arcade, birds peck at fruit, and beneath another a tiny panther drinks from a ewer.

(a) 13.4 in. (34 cm);Purchase, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Douglas Dillon Gift and Rogers Fund, 1967 (67.10a,b);;Late Sasanian silver vessels, particularly bottles and ewers, often were decorated with female figures holding a variety of festal objects. The appearance of these motifs attests to the continuing influence of Greek imagery associated with the wine god Dionysus. On this silver-gilt vessel, floral arches, supported by low pilasters, frame four dancing female figures. Each holds a ceremonial object in either hand: grape and leaf branches, a vessel, a heart-shaped flower. Beneath one arcade, birds peck at fruit, and beneath another a tiny panther drinks from a ewer. Both the females and their decorative motifs recall representations of the maenads, attendants of Dionysus. However, it has been suggested that these figures have been adapted to the cult of the Iranian goddess Anahita.

(11.2 x 8.6 x 1.3 cm);Gift John C. Weber in honor of Philippe de Montebello, 2008 (2008.352);;This image of the Virgin of Compassion, or Virgin Eleousa, is a remarkable addition to the limited number of surviving miniature mosaic icons, a medium first popularized in the Late Byzantine era. The intimate gesture of the Christ Child, his head pressed to his mother's cheek, is one of the most beautiful images in Byzantine art. The poses of the heads and the position of the Christ Child's hand (partially restored) are remarkably similar to a less sophisticated, painted icon of the Virgin and Child in the collection of the Monastery of Saint Catherine at Sinai, where the Christ Child also has light brown hair. Another icon from Sinai, which has five small images of named icons including one labeled the Blachernitissa, echoes the head poses and hand gesture seen in this work. An icon donated to the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, Venice, in the seventeenth century and dated to the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century offers a related pose in its exquisite Virgin with an elaborate halo, although the image of the Christ Child differs, as do elements of the design, including the details of the face.;;The Venice icon and the fourteenth-century mosaic icon of Saint Theodore Theron in the Vatican also possess inscriptions in Latin identifying the images. Here the inscription identifies the work as the icon that inspired the conversion in the fourth century of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The saint's vita describes the event: &quot;Then the ascetic gave her an icon on which was depicted the All-holy Theotokos holding the Divine Child in her arms, and said to her . . . take this to your home . . . pray all night . . . the maiden . . . beheld in her vision, the Queen of the angels, just as she was depicted with the Holy child . . . [the maiden] marveling at this vision . . . received from [the ascetic] Holy Baptism.&quot; The desire to possess the icon by which the saint was converted attests to the popularity of Saint Catherine in the West in the Middle Ages. Though the image of the Virgin and Child displayed here was of a type that became popular in the Middle Byzantine centuries, the Latin inscription indicates that Westerners tended to believe that such Byzantine images of the Virgin and Child were copies of works of a much earlier age, if not originals from the fourth century. It cannot be determined if this icon came to the West with a pilgrim from Sinai, where mosaic icons survive today. The Man of Sorrows mosaic icon at Sante Croce in Gerusalemme, in Rome, is said to have been brought to Rome from Sinai. The miniature mosaic at Galatina is housed in a church dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. There was also a church dedicated to Santa Caterina de' Sacchi in Venice, which was established in 1150 and survived in various forms until 1806. It is tempting to think that this work came from the site where Saint Catherine's relics are venerated.;;Text from <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/icon/ho_2008.352.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/icon/ho_2008.352.htm</a>;  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: icon,ElissaSCA: virgin,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: mosaic,ElissaSCA: middleages,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","2422688095.jpg","16.32.153","Saint James the Less in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2008","ElissaSCA","Workshop of Gil de Siloe;Saint James the Less;;Alabaster;Spanish, Castilian, about 1500;From the Tomb of Juan de Padilla (died 1491), in the monastic church of Eresdelval, now in the Museo Arqueologico Provincial, Burgos;;Accession # 16.32.153;;The Apostle Saint James was one of seven original statues that adorned the summit of the wall tomb of Juan de Padilla, a young knight in the service of the Spanish kings. ;;In style and composition, the statuette recalls the sculpture of Gil de Siloe, yet the quality of execution suggests the hand of a workshop assistant.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: gothic,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: spanish,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: saint,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","2753960548.jpg","47.100.83","Bull's Head from the Top of a Column in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Bull's Head from the Top of a Column;Limestone;Southwestern Iran, excavated at Istakhr, near Persepolis;Achaemenid period, 5th century BC;;Accession # 47.100.83;;The ceilings of porticoes and halls of major buildings at Persepolis were sustained by slender, fluted columns, 60 feet high, topped by a variety of monumental capitals, carefully carved in stone.

Another possible explanation is that the Habsburg emperor Charles V donated the pieces to Spanish churches, or that Spanish officials at his court in Brussels acquired the pieces and brought them back to Spain. ;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: bust,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: saint,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: gothic,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3036511863.jpg","-","NA","Ross Reyes","the met . nyc","Ross Reyes: nyc,Ross Reyes: themet,Ross Reyes: rossreyes,Ross Reyes: museumkids,Ross Reyes: fieldtrip,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3061971900.jpg","26.7.1300","Iron Razor or Folding Knife with Ivory Handle in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2008","ElissaSCA","Iron Razor or Folding Knife with Ivory Handle;2nd-4th centuries AD;Ivory with corroded iron blade;;Accession # 26.7.1300;;The ivory handle has a tiger or panther carved three dimensionally on the outer edge.

Although the text does not specify a relationship, they were probably husband and wife, as is common for pair statues where a relationship is recorded. The pose is unusual because Memi is returning Sabu's embrace by draping his arm around her shoulders. This restricting gesture may account for the fact that he stands with his feet together, rather than striding forward in the normal masculine pose.;;Until recently, this statue was dated to Dynasty 5, but the figures have many features in common with Fourth Dynasty statues found in the nonroyal cemeteries surrounding the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) at Giza.

(121.9 x 15 1/2 x 91.4 cm);Bequest of Lydia Winston Malbin, 1989 (1990.38.3);;The Italian Futurist Umberto Boccioni had a short but very productive life. He worked primarily as a painter, but also produced drawings, prints, and sculptures that were similarly infused with the energetic movement that symbolized the modern machine age. By 1905, he was already acquainted with two other Italian artists, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Balla rel=nofollow>Giacomo Balla</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Severini rel=nofollow>Gino Severini</a>, who would later join him as the leading painters of Italian <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism rel=nofollow>Futurism</a>, and in 1910 he was one of the signers of the first <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist_Manifesto rel=nofollow>Manifesto</a> of the Futurist Painters and the Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting.;When Boccioni began working in three dimensions in Paris around March 1912, he wrote to a friend: &quot;These days I am obsessed by sculpture! I believe I have glimpsed a complete renovation of that mummified art.&quot; A month later, in Milan, he published the <a href=http://www.futurismo.altervista.org/manifesti/scultoriTecFut.htm rel=nofollow>Manifesto tecnico della scultura futurista</a> (<a href=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techsculpt.html rel=nofollow>Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture</a>), and by June 1913 he had created a significant body of eleven plaster sculptures.;Here, in one of Boccioni's few cast pieces, he creates an anonymous superhuman figure striding purposefully through space, but bound to its architectonic base. Considered the most successful of Boccioni's sculptural experiments, this bronze casting was done posthumously in 1949, from the artist's original plaster (which was never cast during his lifetime). As art historian Joshua C. Taylor wrote: &quot;The figure in Unique Forms of Continuity in Space strides forth, a symbol of vitality and strength, yet its impetuous step rests lightly on the ground as if the opposing air gave the figure wings. It is muscular without muscles, and massive without weight. The rhythms of its forms triumph over the limitations of the human stride to suggest unending movement into infinite space&quot; (Futurism [New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1961], p. 93).;;<b>NOTE:</b>

(120.7 x 80 cm);;<i>The Book of Judith has a tragic setting that appealed to Jewish patriots and it warned of the urgency of adhering to Mosaic Law, generally speaking, but what accounted for its enduring appeal was the drama of its narrative. The story revolves around Judith, a daring and beautiful widow, who is upset with her Jewish countrymen for not trusting God to deliver them from their foreign conquerors. She goes with her loyal maid to the camp of the enemy general, Holofernes, to whom she slowly ingratiates herself, promising him information on the Israelites. Gaining his trust, she is allowed access to his tent one night as he lies in a drunken stupor. She decapitates him, then takes his head back to her fearful countrymen. The Assyrians, having lost their leader, disperse, and Israel is saved. Though she is courted by many, she remains unmarried for the rest of her life.</i>;;Taken from Wikipedia","Maulleigh: jeanjoseph,Maulleigh: benjaminconstant,Maulleigh: judith,Maulleigh: benjamin,Maulleigh: constant,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: painting,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3607059537.jpg","-","new york city metropolitan museum of art diana alone american wing","photographynatalia","NA","photographynatalia: newyorkcity,photographynatalia: metropolitanmuseumofart,photographynatalia: americanwing,photographynatalia: diana,photographynatalia: arrow,photographynatalia: gold,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3607217805.jpg","-","new york city metropolitan museum of art roman art metropolitan museum of art","photographynatalia","NA","photographynatalia: newyork,photographynatalia: metropolitanmuseumofart,photographynatalia: romanart,photographynatalia: romanandgreekartwing,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3607873318.jpg","-","new york city metropolitan museum african art","photographynatalia","NA","photographynatalia: newyorkcity,photographynatalia: metropolitanmuseumofart,photographynatalia: africanart,photographynatalia: oceaniawing,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3613145102.jpg","-","Classical Lady","dallascaper","NA","dallascaper: newyorkcity,dallascaper: manhattan,dallascaper: classicalsculpture,dallascaper: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 35","3614969769.jpg","-","Buddha -

(203.84 cm);Gift of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 1932 (32.11.4);;The Amazons were a mythical race of warrior women renowned for their skills in archery and horsemanship. This marble statue depicting a wounded Amazon is a Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 450425 B.C. The original bronze may have stood in the sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesus on the coast of Asia Minor, where the Amazons had legendary and cultic connections with the goddess.;;Here, the mythical warrior woman has been stripped of her weapons and horse, and wounded under her right breast. She wears a short, sleeveless chiton unfastened at one shoulder and belted at the waist with a makeshift bit of bridle from her horse.
