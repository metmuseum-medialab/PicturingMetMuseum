In Christian art birds frequently symbolize the soul, and in Baroque art caged birds are symbolic of innocence. Goya may have intended this portrait as an illustration of the frail boundaries that separate the child's world from the forces of evil or as a commentary on the fleeting nature of innocence and youth. ;;The picture is one of several portraits commissioned by the Altamiras after Goya was appointed painter to the king in 1786.

(52.1 x 91.4 cm);Bequest of Jane Kendall Gingrich, 1982 (1982.55.1);;A self-taught artist from West Chester, Pennsylvania,who started making art at the age of thirty-seven, Horace Pippin was &quot;discovered&quot; by the art world in 1937. Over the next nine years he established a flourishing career, becoming one of the most widely recognized African-American artists in the country and one of a small group of self-taught artists (also called folk or outsider artists) who enjoyed patronage from the artistic mainstream. Having sustained a shoulder injury in World War I, Pippin worked slowly and laboriously. Despite this fact, he produced about one hundred and forty works on canvas and wood panel and numerous drawings between 1925 and 1946. Pippin's subject matter includes themes from history (especially his own experiences fighting in the 369th Infantry Regiment), portraits, and political and religious allegories. He also painted tender and acutely observed scenes of the everyday lives of black and white Americans in and around West Chester.;;&quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; is distinctive in Pippin's work, not only for its landscape setting, but also for its literary subject matter, taken from the Arthurian legends. In Pippin's own inimitable interpretation, the Lady of the Lake is here personified as a nude sunbather at the edge of the water, stretched out on a blanket decorated with what seems to be a Native American design. The figure sits with her face held up to the sun, next to a cabin that seems too small to accommodate her heightan exaggeration of scale and perspective that marks the work of many self-taught artists. On the near shore of the lake rests a canoe. Meadow and forest fill the opposite shore, and mountains rise in the distance. The symmetry is broken only by the trellis with a single, prominent red rose at the lower right of the composition. The artist's use of bright, intense reds and greens is typical of his palette during his period.; ;This painting was done at the end of Pippin's career, when his work had attracted the attention and support of Dr. Albert C.

The artist John Vanderlyn (17751852) had visited Versailles a few years earlier and made sketches to prepare his giant canvas. The panorama was first exhibited in a special building called the Rotunda located near City Hall in downtown New York, and subsequently toured around the country. The artist depicted himself, pointing at Czar Alexander I and the king of Prussia standing around the Basin of Latona, beneath the garden facade of the palace. In addition to the remarkably precise rendering of the palace itself, Vanderlyn provides a detailed view over the main axis, or Allee Royale, to the Grand Canal, now appearing somewhat forlorn without Louis XIV's pleasure boats. A comparison of Vanderlyn's early nineteenth-century rendering of the Versailles gardens and Adam Perelle's seventeenth-century prints (20.41.126) shows that, in spite of the slightly barren look of the grounds and lack of floral detail in parterres, the layout of the garden remains essentially as Andre Le Notre designed it in the late seventeenth century.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gard_2/ho_52.184.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gard_2/ho_52.184.htm</a>  addl  addl Panoramic View of the Palace and Gardens of Versailles John Vanderlyn (American, Kingston, New York 1775–1852 Kingston, New York) Date: 1818–19 Medium: Oil on canvas Accession Number: 52.184 On view in Gallery 735","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,Art2or3,2D,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,AccessionInDesc,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 19","4231344054.jpg","-","Judith with the Head of HolofernesLucas Cranach the Elder (German, 14721553)ca. 1530, detail.

Clark, 1960 (61.101.1) ;;;This scene of peasants playing cards was undertaken in the early 1890s as part of a painting campaign, made up of five distillations of the subject. Cezanne enlisted local farmhands to serve as models, and he may have drawn inspiration for his Provencal genre scene from a painting of the same theme by the Le Nain brothers that was in the museum in Aix.

These elongaged S-shaped channels were a popular form of relief decoration on vases and sarcophagi, especially in the second half of the 2nd century and the 3rd century AD. Two bearded snakes form the handle on either side of the vase. With their upper bodies coiled on the broad shoulder, they stretch their flat heads forward across the deep concavity of the neck to bite the projecting rim, setting up a play of spatial depth and light and dark effects. The motif of entwined serpents is appropriate for a funerary vase. Linked with the earth, snakes were associated chthonian powers, and the Greeks and Romans regarded them as guardians of sacred places, houses, and tombs.

Weber, 1992 (1992.165.21);;The hunping, or funerary urn, is a vessel type whose provenance is generally limited to the area south of the Yangzi River corresponding to modern northern Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. The vessel type dates to the relatively short period of time from about 250 to 300. This magnificent example with olive-green celadon glaze covering the body possesses an extraordinarily rich assortment of modeled figures and architecture in a well-proportioned, tiered arrangement.

These are among the earliest Buddhist images known in China.;;The hunping reflects the southern tradition of &quot;burial of the summoned soul.&quot; Placed in a tomb together with armrests, banqueting tables, food, and drink, it was hoped that the soul of the deceased would return to reside in the urn, entering, in this particular case, through the grand double-tiered gate that appears to lead directly into the vessel.

(96.5 x 68.6 cm);Rogers Fund, 1919 (19.186);;Buddhist images executed in dry lacquer were highly valued by the Chinese because of their costly and time-consuming process of production. There are so few surviving examples that this seated Buddha is especially precious. To fashion the body of the image, the craftsman made a rough form of the sculpture in clay and then applied at least three layers of hemp cloth, each secured with a paste made of raw lacquer (the sap from the lac tree, Rhus verniciflua) and a fine powder of bone, horn, shell, ceramic, stone, or carbon. Each layer had to dry thoroughly before the next could be added. The clay core was then removed from the lacquered image. The head and hands were likely modeled separately, using the same technique as that used for the body, and then attached to the sculpture. The surface was finished with several coatings of pure lacquer and then painted.;;Portrayed as a youthful figure, the Buddha sits in the full lotus position, with his legs tightly interlocked, though the lower part of the sculpture is missing. The position of the damaged arms suggests that the hands performed the gesture of contemplation. The columnar form and lean gracefulness of the figure recall the style of Buddhist sculpture of the late Period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386589), but the attempt to render anatomical differentiation and, in particular, the emotional impact of the Buddha's expression are distinguishing features of early Tang style. The traces of brilliant red and blue, vividly combined to form a stylized floral pattern in the hem of the undergarment crossing the chest, and the remains of shimmering gilt on the surface are evidence of the sumptuous effect of this once colorful figure.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,AccessionInDesc,Description,fresco_mosaic,Artwork","Fresco_Mosaic""SET 19","4619522903.jpg","55.1","Reliquary Shrine of St. Barbara in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2010","ElissaSCA","Workshop of Louis Marcy (?);Reliquary Shrine of St. Barbara;Silver and gilded silver;Made about 1880-1900 in Europe;;Accession # 55.1;;This tower reliquary in the form of a Gothic church incorporates architectural styles of different periods.

(9.19 cm);Rogers Fund, 1910 (10.230.1) ;;This bronze &quot;medallion&quot; portrays a naked youth being bitten on the right shoulder by a griffin. It was found at Praeneste and was originally part of the Barberini collection. The Barberini princes undertook extensive excavations in their estate near Praeneste, and their collection is the largest and most complete assemblage of Praenestine fourth century B.C. material. The high quality of this relief and its skillful manufacture recall objects of Greek craftsmanship. The beautiful modeling is clearly inspired by fourth century B.C. classical idealsthe musculature of the young warrior's body is softly rendered and his wavy hair is raised to suggest movement. The tense muscles and tendons of the griffin's paws transmit the animal's strength and power.;;This &quot;medallion&quot; is shaped like a knob with a flat top. The underpart consists of three nested metal layers, not soldered to the top surface, thus suggesting they were originally two separate pieces. It is likely to be the lid of a vaso a gabbiaa container made of a conical bronze cagelike structure enclosing a leather bag, a local Praenestine fourth century B.C. production. The shape, the size, as well as a little hole that originally would have been attached to a chain with a strigil, all support such an identification.;;The scene depicted is the myth of the Arimaspians, who were believed to have been one-eyed horsemen inhabiting a land beyond the Black Sea. The Arimaspians were involved in a perpetual struggle against griffins over gold, guarded by these fantastic animals. In the mid-seventh century B.C., Aristeas of Proconnesos wrote the Arimaspeia, a poem narrating his travels in eastern Europe. Later ancient writers, like Aeschylus and Herodotus, drew their knowledge of the Arimaspian myth from this poem.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/10.230.1 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/10.230.1</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lid,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: green,ElissaSCA: griffin,ElissaSCA: monster,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 19","5578212627.jpg","06.1101","Terracotta Oinochoe Attributed to the Painter of Louvre CA 1694 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Terracotta oinochoe (jug);;Medium; Technique: Terracotta; red-figure;;Culture: Greek, Attic;;Period: Classical;;Date: ca. 450 B.C.;;Artist or Maker: Attributed to the Painter of Louvre CA 1694;;Dimensions: H. 5 1/4 in.

This one of the grandest preserved. The receptacles probably contained foodstuffs of various kinds, and perhaps also flowers.;;;CYCLADIC ANTIQUITIES ACQUIRED BY METROPOLITAN MUSEUM;(New York, November 5, 2004)The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced today the acquisition of a group of three exceptional Cycladic terracotta vases dating to circa 2000 B.C. Purchased through a gift from The Annenberg Foundation, the group consists of a container for offerings known as a kernos, a tall jar, and a jug.;;&quot;These works are spectacular additions to the Metropolitan Museum's Cycladic collection,&quot; stated Philippe de Montebello, Director of the Metropolitan Museum. &quot;They are powerful as works of art, representing the potter's expertise at its most accomplished, and also serve as rich sources of information about Cycladic culture and its interrelations with neighboring areas such as Crete. Thanks to the generosity of The Annenberg Foundation, the Museum's holdings have been strengthened immeasurably by this acquisition. This is particularly welcome at this crucial time, as the Department of Greek and Roman Art, led by Carlos Picon, is carrying out extensive renovations of their galleries and reinstallation of their collections.&quot;;;The three objects were found together on the Aegean island of Melos in 1829 by a British officer, Captain Richard Copeland, who was surveying in the eastern Mediterranean. They were donated to Eton College in Windsor, England, by Copeland's widow in 1857. The offering vase and the jar were first put on view at the Metropolitan Museum as loans in 1996 on the occasion of the opening of the Robert and Renee Belfer Court, the first phase of the ongoing reinstallation of the Museum's Greek and Roman Galleries. The jug was included in the recent purchase of the group by the Metropolitan. All are now on view together in the Belfer Court, which houses prehistoric and early Greek art.;;The art of the ancient Cycladic islands is most familiar from the elegant marble statuettes, usually of female figures, that were created between about 2800 and 2000 B.C. The same extraordinary level of craftsmanship evident in the statuettes appears in the offering container. Standing 13-5/8 inches high, it consists of a conical stand that supports 25 elongated receptacles, which are connected by a series of small platforms and struts a very early application of the cantilever principle. The two rings of receptacles would probably have contained offerings of natural products such as seeds, grain, fruit, perhaps fibers, and so on. The decoration consists of lines that emphasize the major features of the vase; the blackish-brown glaze is applied over a buff slip that covers the actual surface.;;Although the piece has received some slight repairs, every aspect of its preservation is excellent. Kernoi of this type are associated principally with the island of Melos and have most often been found in tombs. The majority are far simpler, with between three and 12 receptacles. Only a handful of kernoi compare closely with the example now in the Metropolitan Museum; the finest counterparts are in The British Museum, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The newly acquired kernos, arguably the finest preserved, was also the last one in private hands.;;The second object, the jar, probably contained a burial. At 16-3/8 inches in height, it is slightly taller than the kernos. While the shape is well attested, the Eton example is featured throughout the archaeological literature thanks to its superb state of preservation. The decoration is very similar to that of the kernos, also with ","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: bronzeage,ElissaSCA: kernos,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,AccessionInDesc,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,DescriptionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","1143698923.jpg","15.145","Marble Portrait of a Bearded Man in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble portrait of a man;Roman, Hadrianic or Early Antonine period, ca. 117-161 AD;;Accession # 15.145;;This striking young man wears the short beard that became popular in Rome during the early second century AD.

In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief.

There are so few surviving examples that this seated Buddha is especially precious. To fashion the body of the image, the craftsman made a rough form of the sculpture in clay and then applied at least three layers of hemp cloth, each secured with a paste made of raw lacquer (the sap from the lac tree, Rhus verniciflua) and a fine powder of bone, horn, shell, ceramic, stone, or carbon. Each layer had to dry thoroughly before the next could be added. The clay core was then removed from the lacquered image. The head and hands were likely modeled separately, using the same technique as that used for the body, and then attached to the sculpture. The surface was finished with several coatings of pure lacquer and then painted.;;Portrayed as a youthful figure, the Buddha sits in the full lotus position, with his legs tightly interlocked, though the lower part of the sculpture is missing. The position of the damaged arms suggests that the hands performed the gesture of contemplation. The columnar form and lean gracefulness of the figure recall the style of Buddhist sculpture of the late Period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386589), but the attempt to render anatomical differentiation and, in particular, the emotional impact of the Buddha's expression are distinguishing features of early Tang style. The traces of brilliant red and blue, vividly combined to form a stylized floral pattern in the hem of the undergarment crossing the chest, and the remains of shimmering gilt on the surface are evidence of the sumptuous effect of this once colorful figure.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","1722382226.jpg","74.51.2453","Detail of the Cypriot Sarcophagus in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Sarcophagus, second quarter of 5th century B.C.; Archaic;Cypriot; From Amathus;Limestone; H. 62 in.

Most likely, the figure standing under a parasol in the first chariot represents the deceased. His horses, like the others, are richly caparisoned, but the wheels of his chariot have fewer spokes. Splendidly embellished horses and chariot poles are part of a long tradition on Cyprus, although scholars have suggested that the prototypes for the chariot procession on the Amathus sarcophagus may have been Graeco-Persian reliefs.;;One of the short sides of the sarcophagus originally was decorated with four figures of the Egyptian god Bes. The cult of Bes was especially popular at Amathus, primarily because of the Phoenician presence in the city. The other short side of the sarcophagus shows four standing figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte. Nude except for their ornate necklaces, the four figures of the goddess hold their breasts in a pose that is well attested in Cypriot terracotta sculpture from the sixth century B.C. The temple of Astarte, located on the acropolis of Amathus, was one of the most important sanctuaries on Cyprus. The depictions of Bes and Astarte on this particular sarcophagus suggest the importance of procreation to the deceased.;;Most of the architectural moldings and the decorative details on the sarcophagus, such as the carved palmettes and ivy leaves that fill the four panels, are of eastern Greek origin. Other floral motifs, such as the tree of life and a frieze of lotus flowers and buds, had a long tradition in Cypriot vase painting and other arts of the Archaic and later periods. The figural panels are framed by a variety of vegetal ornaments, while the gabled lid once featured a pair of sphinxes and a palmette at each end. The thorough integration of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Cypriot stylistic elements on the Amathus sarcophagus is characteristic of Cypriot art and culture during the fifth century B.C.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm</a>  addl Accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,AccessionInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","2088646375.jpg","1997.145.2a","Etruscan Painted Terracotta Antefix with the Head of a Woman in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Terracotta Antefix (roof tile);Etruscan, late 6th century BC;Head of a woman with diadem;;Accession # 1997.145.2a;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: etruscan,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: antefix,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: woman,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,Description,AccessionInDesc,MetropolitanInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","2088646379.jpg","1997.145.2a","Detail of an Etruscan Painted Terracotta Antefix with the Head of a Woman in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sept. 2007","ElissaSCA","Terracotta Antefix (roof tile);Etruscan, late 6th century BC;Head of a woman with diadem;;Accession # 1997.145.2a;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: etruscan,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: antefix,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: woman,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,Description,AccessionInDesc,MetropolitanInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","2293021166.jpg","12.229.20","Terracotta Plaque With Phrixos on the Ram in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2007","ElissaSCA","Terracotta plaque ;Greek, Melian, ca. 450 BC;Phrixos carried over the sea by a ram;;Accession # 12.229.20;;Phrixos and his sister, Helle, were threatened with death by their stepmother, the wife of King Athamas, who ruled part of Thessaly.

Rockefeller, 1979 (1979.206.86);;The leaders of the kingdom of Benin in present-day Nigeria trace their origins to a ruling dynasty that began in the fourteenth century. The title of &quot;oba,&quot; or king, is passed on to the firstborn son of each successive king of Benin at the time of his death. The first obligation of each new king during this transition of rule is to commemorate his father with a portrait cast in bronze and placed on an altar at the palace. The altar constitutes an important site of palace ritual and is understood to be a means of incorporating the ongoing influence of past kings in the affairs of their descendents.;;Though associated with individuals, this highly stylized genre of commemorative portraiture emphasized the trappings and regalia of kingship rather than specific facial features. In the Edo world view, the head is considered the locus of a man's knowledge, authority, success, and family leadership. The burden of providing for his family and seeing them through times of trouble is often described as being &quot;on his head.&quot; The oba is often called by his praise name &quot;Great Head,&quot; accentuating the head of the living leader as the locus of responsibility over and for the Benin kingdom.;;The idealized naturalism of this work reflects conventions of depicting the king at the prime of his life. The straightforward gazing eyes, which would have included iron inlays, possess the ability to see into the other world, communicating the divine power of the oba to survey his kingdom. The beaded headdress and collar are depictions of the king's coral regalia. Coral is of particular importance to the Edo because of its associations with the ancestral realms of the sea and to the immense wealth of the oba gained through ocean-going trade with Europe.;;The relatively minimal amount of brass used to make this light cast and the proportionately small amount of regalia depicted indicate that the head was created during the earlier half of the sixteenth century. Art historians have suggested that over the centuries, as greater quantities of brass became available, casters had less incentive to be economical with the material, and the trappings of office worn by the kings of Benin became more ostentatious.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/sfg/ho_1979.206.86.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/sfg/ho_1979.206.86.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: african,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: benin,ElissaSCA: brass,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","2749948917.jpg","57.51.18","Carved Stucco Standing Figure in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","The Tradition of Carved Stucco;;In the ancient Near East, stucco was used to decorate architectural facades.

(96.5 x 68.6 cm);Rogers Fund, 1919 (19.186);;Buddhist images executed in dry lacquer were highly valued by the Chinese because of their costly and time-consuming process of production. There are so few surviving examples that this seated Buddha is especially precious. To fashion the body of the image, the craftsman made a rough form of the sculpture in clay and then applied at least three layers of hemp cloth, each secured with a paste made of raw lacquer (the sap from the lac tree, Rhus verniciflua) and a fine powder of bone, horn, shell, ceramic, stone, or carbon. Each layer had to dry thoroughly before the next could be added. The clay core was then removed from the lacquered image. The head and hands were likely modeled separately, using the same technique as that used for the body, and then attached to the sculpture. The surface was finished with several coatings of pure lacquer and then painted.;;Portrayed as a youthful figure, the Buddha sits in the full lotus position, with his legs tightly interlocked, though the lower part of the sculpture is missing. The position of the damaged arms suggests that the hands performed the gesture of contemplation. The columnar form and lean gracefulness of the figure recall the style of Buddhist sculpture of the late Period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386589), but the attempt to render anatomical differentiation and, in particular, the emotional impact of the Buddha's expression are distinguishing features of early Tang style. The traces of brilliant red and blue, vividly combined to form a stylized floral pattern in the hem of the undergarment crossing the chest, and the remains of shimmering gilt on the surface are evidence of the sumptuous effect of this once colorful figure.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","4762238523.jpg","-","-","-","10.105.124.130","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","4812976541.jpg","89.2.2141","Terracotta Statuette of an Emaciated Woman in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, June 2010","ElissaSCA","Terracotta statuette of an emaciated woman;Greek, Asia Minor, Smyrna, 1st century BC;Said to have been found near Ephesos.;;Accession # 89.2.2141;;This statuette of an emaciated woman with elongated proportions is a striking portrayal of the human condition.

H. Herriman, 1911;11.68.1;;American Neoclassical sculptors frequently mined classical mythology for thematic inspiration. In book 4 of the <i> Metamorphoses</i> , the Roman poet Ovid tells the story of Clytie, a water nymph who was abandoned by Apollo, the sun god. Clytie gazed inconsolably at the sun for nine days, languishing nude, without food or drink. For her constancy, she was changed into a sunflower so that her face would forever follow the sun as it moved across the sky. Rinehart subtly evoked Ovids story by depicting a drooping sunflower in Clyties right hand. The tree stump with live sunflower plants serves both to enhance the narrative and to offer tensile support for the marble figure.;;;From the placard: Metropolitan Museum of Art.;;;<b><a

Matisse / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York ;;;The posed female figure, either fully or partially dressed or in the nude, is one of the central themes in Matisse's work during the early Nice period (191730). In 1927, the year of this sculpture, he returned to the subject of the reclining odalisque, which he had first explored twenty years earlier in Reclining Nude, I (19067, bronze, Museum of Modern Art, New York). In all, Matisse modeled three successive versions of this reclining figure in plaster (in 1907, 1927, and 1929), all of which were cast in bronze. The pose of this second version, Reclining Nude, II, is more frontal, with the sinuous curve of the body now extending from her toes to her head and upraised elbow. The modeling here is also more severe; the figure's back has received bold slicing and wedge cuts. As Alfred H. Barr, Jr., so aptly observed, it appears &quot;more monumental partly because of certain shrewd exaggerations such as the columnar left arm, partly because it is quiet rather than turbulently active.&quot; No other sculpture by Matisse so frequently appears in his paintings, where it is incorporated into still-life arrangements and room interiors.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1996.403.16 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1996.403.16</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: matisse,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bronze,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","5588606172.jpg","-","The Greek and Roman gallery at night","dakw23","NA","dakw23: raw,dakw23: metropolitanmuseum,dakw23: greek,dakw23: roman,dakw23: statue,dakw23: available,dakw23: light,dakw23: voigtlander,dakw23: nokton,dakw23: 50mm,dakw23: f11,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","5595797824.jpg","-","IMG_8462","EN.Carin","NA","EN.Carin: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","5601498964.jpg","-","Three Graces and a Young Hercules","CVerwaal","Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.;Olympus OM4T, Zuiko 50mm f1.4, Kodak TriX.;","CVerwaal: nyc,CVerwaal: newyork,CVerwaal: newyorkcity,CVerwaal: romanart,CVerwaal: girls,CVerwaal: om,CVerwaal: kodak,CVerwaal: trix,CVerwaal: zuiko,CVerwaal: ishootfilm,CVerwaal: oldschool,CVerwaal: analog,CVerwaal: olympusom4ti,CVerwaal: metropolitanmuseumofart,3D,Art2or3,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","5604325135.jpg","1986.306","Vishnu Rescuing Gajendra, the Lord of the Elephants in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title/Object Name: Vishnu Rescuing Gajendra, the Lord of the Elephants;;Culture: India (Jammu &amp; Kashmir, ancient kingdom of Kashmir);;Date: 8th9th century;;Medium: Stone;;Dimensions: H. 3 1/4 in.

(182.9 cm);Classification: Sculpture;;A Hindu temple was often envisioned as the world's central axis, in the form of a mountain inhabited by a god. The temple itself was therefore worshiped. This was done by circumambulation (walking around the exterior, in this case in a counterclockwise direction) and by viewing its small inner sanctum. The outside of the temple was usually covered with myriad reliefs: some portrayed aspects of the god within or related deities; others represented the mountain's mythological inhabitants. From early times iconic representations of deities and holy figures were augmented by auspicious images, such as beautiful women, musicians, and loving couples (mithunas). ;;Once part of the subsidiary decoration of a temple facade, the figures of this bejeweled couple embrace while peering rapturously into each other's eyes. Their full bodies and broad, detailed features are characteristic of architectural sculptures produced in thirteenth-century Orissa, a region in northeast India that was noted for its temples, particularly those built from the tenth through the thirteenth century, often distinguished by figures in astonishingly acrobatic and erotic poses. Couples such as this pair are understood to have multiple meanings, ranging from an obvious celebration of life's pleasures to the more metaphorical symbolism of a human soul's longing for union with the divine.;; branko;<a href=http://www.a2b1.com rel=nofollow>www.a2b1.com</a>;youtube channel: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/a2b1 rel=nofollow>www.youtube.com/a2b1</a>","branko_: metropolitanmuseum,branko_: metropolitan,branko_: museum,branko_: art,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: manhattan,branko_: nyc,branko_: branko,branko_: leica,branko_: m9,branko_: loving,branko_: couple,branko_: mithuna,branko_: hindu,branko_: deities,branko_: holy,branko_: figure,branko_: orissa,branko_: northeast,branko_: india,branko_: temple,branko_: erotic,branko_: pose,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","5623511656.jpg","-","IMGP1300","Marat Elkanidze","NA","Marat Elkanidze: sculptures,Marat Elkanidze: metropolitanmuseum,Marat Elkanidze: demidofftable,Marat Elkanidze: lorenzobartolini,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","5626532192.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","738046742.jpg","-","Most Beautiful Work of Art in the Museum","Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views)","NY Metropolitan Museum of Art","Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): ny,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): nyc,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): metropolitan,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): museum,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): art,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): egyptian,Stanley Zimny (Thank You for 10 Million views): sculpture,3D,Art2or3,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 19","922863379.jpg","91.8","Bust of Herodotus in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble bust of Herodotus;Roman, Imperial period, 2nd century AD;Copy of a Greek bronze statue of the 1st half of the 4th century BC;Found in Benha, ancient Athribis, Lower Egypt;Inscribed HERODOTOS;;Accession # 91.8;;Herodotus (ca. 484-424 BC) of Halikarnassos achived fame in his lifetime for his Histories, which chronicle the Greek wars with Persia in the first quarter of the 5th century BC and the years surrounding those monumentous events.
