Decorated with a frieze depicting the Triumph of Galatea and supported by three Tritons, the harpsichord originally formed part of Michele Todini's Galeria Armonica and was described in his catalogue of 1676. The flanking figures of Polyphemus playing a bagpipe (Todini invented one like it) and Galatea, holding a lute, were displayed with the harpsichord in front of a &quot;mountain&quot; in which a small pipe organ was concealed. The organ simulated the bagpipe's sound and the harpsichord represented the sound of the lute. Todini designed several such lavish instruments and charged admission from the aristocrats who visited his gallery. The artistic quality of the case ranks it among the finest examples of Roman Baroque decorative art; Todini's ingenuity and search for new forms of instrumental expressivity grew out of the same musical climate that led to the invention of the piano.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/180014140 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1800...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: baroque,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,2D,Artwork,musical_and_painting","Musical_Instrument""SET 07","7061086747.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

Thus the picture became one of two friends or sisters. ;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110002449 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1100...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: impressionism,ElissaSCA: degas,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: pastel,AccessionInDesc,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 07","6972168024.jpg","15.142.1","Tyrolese Interior _TheMET(5)","rverc","John Singer Sargent (1856 1925);<b><i> Tyrolese Interior </i></b> 1915;Oil on canvas;During the summer of 1914, Sargent and some friends visited the Austrian Tyrol.

(74.9 x 109.9 cm) ;;Classification: Paintings ;;Credit Line: Hugo Kastor Fund, 1962 ;;Accession Number: 62.95;;Description:;; Edward Hopper's early training from 1900 to 1906 at the New York School of Art with Robert Henri, leader of The Eight, and his work as an illustrator between 1899 and 1924, led him to paint realistic scenes of urban and rural America. In 1924 a successful gallery exhibition in New York enabled him to give up commercial work altogether and concentrate full time on painting. Hopper depicted his favored subjects cityscapes, landscapes, and room interiors solemnly, in carefully composed compositions that seem timeless and frozen but are animated by the effects of natural and man-made light. As fellow painter Charles Burchfield wrote for the catalogue of the Museum of Modern Art's 1933 Hopper retrospective: &quot;Hopper's viewpoint is essentially classic; he presents his subjects without sentiment, propaganda, or theatrics. He is the pure painter, interested in his material for its own sake, and in the exploitation of his idea of form, color, and space division.&quot;;;In &quot;The Lighthouse at Two Lights&quot; Hopper isolated the dramatic silhouette of the 120-foot-high lighthouse tower and adjoining Coast Guard station against the open expanse of blue sky. Set on a rocky promontory in Cape Elizabeth, Maine though no water is visible in the painting the architecture is bathed in bright sunlight offset by dark shadows. Since 1914 Hopper had regularly summered in Maine, and this picture is one of three oils and several watercolors that he did of this site during summer 1929. To Hopper, the lighthouse at Two Lights symbolized the solitary individual stoically facing the onslaught of change in an industrial society. The integrity and clarity of his work made Hopper a quiet force in American art for forty years and one of America's most popular artists.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/210009492 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/2100...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: architecture,ElissaSCA: hopper,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lighthouse,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 07","7008690135.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

He signaled the presence of poetic content by drenching the view in mellow light.

The pink, or carnation, is a traditional symbol of love and marriage. ;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001852 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1100...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: dutch,ElissaSCA: baroque,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: rembrandt,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: portrait,AccessionInDesc,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 07","6866250080.jpg","29.100.107","Bouquet of Sunflowers","priscillajp","Claude Monet;Bouquet of Sunflowers, 1881;Oil on canvas;;@ The Metropolitan Museum of Art  addl Bouquet of Sunflowers Claude Monet (French, Paris 1840–1926 Giverny) Date: 1881 Medium: Oil on canvas Accession Number: 29.100.107 On view in Gallery 819","priscillajp: bouquet,priscillajp: sunflowers,priscillajp: claude,priscillajp: monet,priscillajp: 1881,priscillajp: oil,priscillajp: canvas,priscillajp: met,priscillajp: metropolitan,priscillajp: museum,priscillajp: nyc,priscillajp: ny,priscillajp: new,priscillajp: york,priscillajp: usa,priscillajp: eua,priscillajp: united,priscillajp: states,priscillajp: america,priscillajp: 2011,priscillajp: winter,priscillajp: inverno,priscillajp: holiday,priscillajp: trip,priscillajp: metropolitanmuseum,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 07","6945716966.jpg","1975.1.159","HouseBehindTheTrees_TheMET(4)","rverc","Georges Braque;French, 1882-1963;<b><i> House Behind the Trees </i></b>;;Robert Lehman Collection, 1975;1975.1.159;;From the placard: Metropolitan Museum of Art;;  addl accession","rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,rverc: europeanpainting,rverc: georgesbraque,rverc: met,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 07","6967217334.jpg","05.42","The Adoration of the Shepherds by El Greco in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2010","ElissaSCA","The Adoration of the Shepherds;;El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (Greek, Candia [Iraklion] 1540/411614 Toledo) ;;Date: ca. 1610 ;;Medium: Oil on canvas ;;Dimensions: 56 7/8 x 39 7/8 in.

(68.5 cm);Rogers Fund, 1910 (10.210.7);;This tall wide-mouthed amphora represents the fully developed Geometric style and illustrates the profoundly significant shift of focus from abstract design to the human figure. Decorative bands, consisting of a zigzag, crosshatching, and dots, fill the area above and below the two main figural scenes. On each side of the amphora's neck is a warrior with a round shield poised between two horses; a long-legged bird stands beneath each horse. Five two-horse chariots with charioteers parade around the belly of the vessel. Each driver wears a long robe and holds four reins, signifying that two horses, not one, pull each chariot. Anatomical details of the warriors, charioteers, and horses have been reduced to simple geometric shapes. Characteristically, the heads are rendered in profile and the bodies in three-quarter view. Scattered lozenges, zigzags, and other shapes fill the background of both figural scenes. Snakes modeled in the round set off the lip, shoulder, and tall handles of the amphora.;;Armed warriors, chariots, and horses are the most familiar iconography of the Geometric period. Whether these images reflect a real world of military threat and conflict, or refer to the heroic deeds of ancestors, is a longstanding debate in studies of Geometric art. Snakes, traditionally associated with death, probably refer to this amphora's function as a funerary dedication.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grge/ho_10.210.7.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grge/ho_10.210.7.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: geometric,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: amphora,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 07","2198234510.jpg","10.210.8","Unattributed Terracotta Neck-Amphora in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oct. 2007","ElissaSCA","Front view.;;Terracotta neck-amphora;Greek (Attic, Geometric), fourth quarter of the 8th century BC;;Accession # 10.210.8;;The procession of chariots on the body is complemented by heraldic lions on the shoulder and mourning women on the neck.

For over a century, representations on vases document that wine, women, and song were central ingredients. Even more worthy of emphasis, however, is the importance of the symposium as an institution that permitted citizens to gather, to transact business, andas Plato's dialogue makes clearto engage in serious discussion. An essential piece of equipment for the symposium was the vase in which the wine was diluted with water and from which it was served.;;In black-figure vase-painting before the last quarter of the sixth century B.C., the decoration of large, elaborate kraters tended to be mythological. (On red-figure vases, the symposium itself was often depicted.) This krater is of exceptional significance because it is one of the first on which wine, women, and song are presented, albeit in a mythological guise.;;The subject, which encompasses both sides of the vase, is the return of Hephaistos to Mount Olympos, the home of the gods. Hephaistos, the divine smith, was the son of Hera and Zeus. Because he was born lame, his mother cast him out of Olympos. In revenge, Hephaistos fashioned a throne that held Hera fast when she sat on it. only Hephaistos could release her. Therefore, he was given wine and escorted to Olympos by Dionysos, the god of wine, accompanied by his male and female followers, the satyrs and maenads.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/130013841 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1300...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lydos,ElissaSCA: blackfigure,ElissaSCA: krater,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: satyr,ElissaSCA: god,ElissaSCA: mythology,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 07","7122383857.jpg","1989.281.72","Detail of a Terracotta Lekythos Attributed to the Achilles Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, April 2011","ElissaSCA","Terracotta lekythos (oil flask);;Attributed to the Achilles Painter ;;Period: Classical ;;Date: ca. 440 B.C. ;;Culture: Greek, Attic ;;Medium: Terracotta ;;Dimensions: H. 14 3/4 in.

Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expressionall of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a).;;Reconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. ;;The overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor. In fact, the boots Gallus wears are of a type often shown in representations of boxers, and would have been more appropriate for the palaestra, or exercise yard, than the imperial court.;;Although his pose is one routinely adopted by Roman emperorsrecalling Greek heroic and athletic nude statuesthe disproportion, wrestling gear, brutish crew cut, and stubble beard no longer evoke the ideals of classical Greece as in the days of Augustus. The technique of negative carving, which had been designed in the early third century for stone portraits of Caracalla, is here successfully used in the decoration of metal. This abbreviated style befits Gallus, an emperor who both achieved and lost the throne at the hands of the soldiers he led.; ;Text (slightly abridged) from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm</a>;;For an article on the conservation of this work: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_2003/roman.asp rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_...</a>;;and;;Bronze statue of the emperor Trebonianus Gallus;Roman, 251-253 AD;Said to have been found near the church of Saint John the Lateran in Rome;;Accession # 05.30;;This monumental bronze statue is one of the very few nearly complete Roman bronze statues of the third century preserved today. It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different. Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived. Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos. In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism. Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or a short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand. ;;The statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth centur","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: trebonianusgallus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: portrait,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 07","1110374485.jpg","-","Copy of the Augustus of Prima Porta in a Ground-Floor Hallway in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","It's not the original; that's in Rome.

As recounted in the epic Ramayana, the courage and loyalty of Hanuman make him the supreme example of those virtues. In Chola bronze sculpture, Hanuman is almost always depicted standing and bent slightly forward, as if in obeisance before Rama. He is usually part of a larger group that includes Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita.;;Standing on a double-lotus pedestal on a tiered base, Hanuman is shown in graceful contrapposto, his left leg bent and the weight of his body resting on his rigid right leg.

(51.6 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1932 (32.11.1);;This kouros is one of the earliest marble statues of a human figure carved in Attica. The rigid stance, with the left leg forward and arms at the side, was derived from Egyptian art. The pose provided a clear, simple formula that was used by Greek sculptors throughout the sixth century B.C. In this early figure, geometric, almost abstract forms predominate, and anatomical details are rendered in beautiful analogous patterns. The statue marked the grave of a young Athenian aristocrat. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;viewMode=0&amp;item=32.11.1 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;vie...</a>  addl Marble statue of a kouros (youth) Date: ca. 590–580 B.C.

Decorated with a frieze depicting the Triumph of Galatea and supported by three Tritons, the harpsichord originally formed part of Michele Todini's Galeria Armonica and was described in his catalogue of 1676. The flanking figures of Polyphemus playing a bagpipe (Todini invented one like it) and Galatea, holding a lute, were displayed with the harpsichord in front of a &quot;mountain&quot; in which a small pipe organ was concealed. The organ simulated the bagpipe's sound and the harpsichord represented the sound of the lute. Todini designed several such lavish instruments and charged admission from the aristocrats who visited his gallery. The artistic quality of the case ranks it among the finest examples of Roman Baroque decorative art; Todini's ingenuity and search for new forms of instrumental expressivity grew out of the same musical climate that led to the invention of the piano.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/180014140 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1800...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: baroque,ElissaSCA: catchycolors,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 07","6943471008.jpg","1987.218.5","Fasting Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2010","ElissaSCA","Fasting Buddha Shakyamuni;;Period: Kushan period ;;Date: 3rd5th century ;;Culture: Pakistan (ancient region of Gandhara) ;;Medium: Schist ;;Dimensions: H. 10 15/16 in.

A friend commissioned a portrait of Mrs. Stokes from Sargent as a wedding gift; the artist selected a blue satin evening gown for her to wear and began the sittings. He soon decided, however to portray her instead in the less formal outfit in which she had walked to his studio on day. When the dog that Sargent wanted to include in the portrait was unavailable, Mr. Stokes had a sudden inspiration, he later recalled, and offered to assume the role of the Great Dane in the picture, thereby getting two portraits for the price of one.;Bequest of Edith Minturn Phelps Stokes (Mrs. I .
