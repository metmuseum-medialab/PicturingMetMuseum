(Fetti had moved to Venice following a fight with a fellow artist; between 1614 and 1622 he had worked for the Gonzaga court in Mantua.)

Painted during the winter of 185152, &quot;Young Ladies of the Village&quot; was preceded by several studies including an oil sketch (Leeds City Art Gallery) in which Courbet established the leading features of the Metropolitan's picture. In this, the final work, he gave the figures a more prominent role and altered the landscape, omitting the two large trees that in the study are silhouetted against the sky. He also repainted and enlarged the cattle. When the work was exhibited in the Salon of 1852, critics bitterly attacked it, finding it tasteless and clumsy and berating the common features and countrified costumes of the three girls, the &quot;ridiculous&quot; little dog and cattle, and the painting's overall lack of unity, including traditional perspective and scale. Ironically, the very effects that Courbet worked hardest to achieve were the ones that proved most troublesome.","Maulleigh: young,Maulleigh: women,Maulleigh: from,Maulleigh: village,Maulleigh: gustave,Maulleigh: courbet,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 41","3087267955.jpg","-","NA","litherland","Sometimes I wonder if the difference between Catholicism and Protestantism seems confusing to non-Christians. (I guess I would consider myself a &quot;cultural&quot; Christian in the sense that I was baptized and attended Sunday school and occasional church services as a child.) An important difference between Catholicism and Protestantism, to my mind, is imagery. The image of the crucifixion, which I find grotesque, figures prominently in Catholicism but is negligible in the Protestant tradition (in my experience). As someone who was brought up in the latter tradition, Catholicism has always impressed me as dramatic and flamboyant. It's just a question of what one is used to; it's hard for me to reach outside of understatedness.","litherland: met,litherland: metropolitanmuseumofart,litherland: round,litherland: window,litherland: crucifixion,litherland: newyork,litherland: metropolitanmuseum,Art2or3,Inhabited,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 41","3088036456.jpg","-","concert","rosetry845","medieval christmas harps psaltry","rosetry845: nyc,rosetry845: metropolitanmuseumofart,rosetry845: metropolitanmuseum,rosetry845: timewemet,3D,Art2or3,musical_instrument,Artwork","Musical_Instrument""SET 41","3087199973.jpg","-","Siren bronze 1570-90","rosetry845","NA","rosetry845: nyc,rosetry845: metropolitanmuseumofart,rosetry845: metropolitanmuseum,rosetry845: timewemet,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 41","3069537628.jpg","-","The Met","eamondude","NA","eamondude: nikon,eamondude: d200,eamondude: metropolitanmuseumofart,eamondude: nyc,eamondude: manhattan,eamondude: uppereastside,eamondude: ues,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 41","3067637287.jpg","-","Met Shadow 1","jebb","NA","jebb: metmuseum,jebb: metropolitanmuseumofart,jebb: newyorkcity,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 41","3123199108.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Tom Jolly","NA","Tom Jolly: metropolitanmuseumofart,Tom Jolly: newyork,Tom Jolly: shadows,Tom Jolly: flickr,Tom Jolly: newyorkcity,Tom Jolly: manhattan,Tom Jolly: greekromanart,Tom Jolly: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 41","3068827156.jpg","-","death on boats","sfofie","I &lt;3 little bronze age (?)

Schoenborn, 1995 (1995.403.14);;Although the painting is neither signed nor dated, stylistically it belongs to the group of still lifes Gris composed while in Ceret, a small town in the Pyrenees, from August to October 1913. It was a most productive period for the artist. By then he had developed a colorful Cubist style of broad, angular, overlapping planes, a style that within a year would evolve into a fully formed Synthetic Cubism, influenced by Picasso's and Braque's papiers collees.;;On the simulated wood-grain table rest three playing cardsheart, diamond, and cluba violin, and the newspaper Le Journal.

Cuauhtemoc 06059, Mexico, D.F.;;This painting is an excellent example of Diego Rivera's fully developed Cubist idiom, which he began to practice in Paris early in 1914 and continued to explore until 1917. Initially he created paintings that were stylistically close to those of the &quot;minor&quot; Cubists: Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Jean Metzinger. Beginning in 1914, however, the dominant influences became those of the Spaniards Juan Gris and Pablo Picasso.;;Rivera's interest in contrasting textures and his use of pointillist technique is clearly manifest throughout the composition. Yet his Synthetic Cubist forms are more ornamental, the color is brighter and livelier, and the contrast fuller. Additionally, he has introduced elements of Mexican iconography, such as the cigar box with a tiny label, highlighting the partial letters BENITO JUA with a miniature Mexican landscape inscribed into it.;;This is one of the three most important works the artist executed in 1915, and one of three paintings acquired by the famous photographer and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz.","Maulleigh: diego,Maulleigh: rivera,Maulleigh: table,Maulleigh: cafe,Maulleigh: terrace,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 41","3119429098.jpg","29.160.26","The Rehearsal Onstage, 1874?","Maulleigh","The Rehearsal Onstage, 1874?;Edgar Degas (French, 18341917);Pastel over brush-and-ink drawing on thin cream-colored wove paper, laid down on bristol board and mounted on canvas; 21 x 28 1/2 in.

(115.6 x 145.4 cm);Bequest of Miss Adelaide Milton de Groot (18761967), 1967 (67.187.68);;The Belgian artist James Ensor saw himself as the modern interpreter of the type of nightmare fantasies painted by the fifteenth-century Dutch artist Hieronymus Bosch. Ensor spent his entire life in Ostend, Belgium, a famous nineteenth-century seaside resort whose carnival atmosphere turned dark and sinister in his paintings. Ensor's natural predilection for the macabre had a firm basis in reality when he painted The Banquet of the Starved in 1915. Late in 1914, German troops had invaded Belgium. While most of Ensor's friends fled to England, he remained in Ostend for the duration of the war. Under Occupation, Belgium suffered terrible food shortages, and this, together with Ensor's disdain for the invaders, probably prompted this painting. Seated around a table like a traditional Last Supper are a host of grotesque and masked figures engaged in disturbing acts of murder, seduction, flattery, and illness. The meager meal laid out on the table is decidedly unappetizing, and the skeleton pictures on the wall increase the unsettling effect of the whole picture. Long before Expressionism became a recognized style of painting, Ensor ravaged his canvas with brutal brushwork.","Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: banquet,Maulleigh: starved,Maulleigh: james,Maulleigh: ensor,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 41","3067284760.jpg","-","Still Life with a Ginger Jar and Eggplants, 189094","Maulleigh","Still Life with a Ginger Jar and Eggplants, 189094;Paul Cezanne (French, 18391906);Oil on canvas; 28 1/2 x 36 in.

Collectively known as Album, they took the title of the largest of the paintings, in which a portfolio or album is the center of attention. Languid women suspended in sumptuous, flower-filled interiors are the subject of all five paintings, which are of various sizes. Figures and objects blend in a profusion of patterns, and their closely ranged tonalities of earthy browns, burgundies, and yellows evoke tapestries.;;The panels' unusual character matched that of the Natansons' apartment on rue Saint-Florentin, just off the place de la Concorde, which consisted of a large open space adjoined by several small alcove areas. Its unconventional decor reflected Misia's taste, which was inspired by the English Arts and Crafts movement. Also called the &quot;Annex,&quot; the apartment often served as an alternative office for the artists and writers who contributed to Thadee's lively avant-garde journal, La Revue Blanche; among them were Claude Debussy, Leon Blum, Stephane Mallarme, and Andre Gide. The evocative Symbolist qualities of Mallarme's poetry and Debussy's music also find echoes in Vuillard's five panels.","Maulleigh: edouard,Maulleigh: vuillard,Maulleigh: album,Maulleigh:
