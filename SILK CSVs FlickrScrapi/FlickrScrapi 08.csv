With Thomas Cole as their leader, they created an American landscape vision based on the exploration of nature, seen as a resource for spiritual renewal and an expression of cultural and national identity.

L'Estaque was no stranger to French artists, who for decades had traveled to the Mediterranean in search of sunlight and crystalline waters. Paul Cezanne painted there intermittently for three decades.;;&quot;House behind Trees&quot; is markedly Fauve in all aspects, taking its cue-sharp, bright colors, broad blue/black outlines, flattened space, use of white paint or untouched primed ground-from Vlaminck, Derain and Matisse, whose own startling Fauve canvases debuted at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1905. Braque's undulating dark outlines and dazzling patches of unmixed color give the canvas a staccato-like rhythm and decorative visual appeal. Braque's flirtation with Fauvism was short-lived, for by the fall of 1907 he was well on his way to the subdued palette and robust, volumetric constructions of Cubism.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/the_robert_lehman_collection/house_behind_trees_georges_braque/objectview.aspx?OID=150000193&amp;collID=15&amp;dd1=15 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/the_ro...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: landscape,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: house,ElissaSCA: tree,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: braque,ElissaSCA: fauvism,Art2or3,2D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","2449781927.jpg","1975.1.199","Young Girl Bathing by Renoir in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2008","ElissaSCA","Young Girl Bathing, 1892;Pierre-Auguste Renoir (French, 18411919);Oil on canvas; 32 x 25 1/2 in.

The painting combines elements of the artist's earlier depictions of the nude as perfectly natural, from the 1870s, with the classical bearing seen in his nudes of the 1880s.

The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.;;Although the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times.

(98.1 x 129.9 cm);;Monet painted this canvas in the summer of 1867 in a Sainte-Adresse garden with a view of Honfleur at the horizon. The models were probably Monet's father, Adolphe, in the foreground; Monet's cousin Jeanne Marguerite Lecadre at the garden fence; Dr. Adolphe Lecadre, her father; and perhaps Lecadre's other daughter, Sophie, the woman seated in the foreground with her back to the viewer. Although this scene projects affluent domesticity, it is by no means a family portrait. Monet's relations with his father were tense that summer, owing to family disapproval of the young artist's liaison with his companion, Camille Doncieux. Monet called this work &quot;the Chinese painting in which there are flags&quot;; Renoir referred to it as &quot;the Japanese painting with little flags.&quot; In the 1860s, the composition's flat horizontal bands of color would have reminded sophisticated viewers of Japanese color wood-block prints, which were avidly collected by Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler, and others in their circle. The print by the Japanese artist Hokusai that may have inspired this picture remains today at Monet's house at Giverny.  addl Garden at Sainte-Adresse Claude Monet (French, Paris 1840–1926 Giverny) Date: 1867 Medium: Oil on canvas Accession Number: 67.241 On view in Gallery 818","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6813521830.jpg","1976.201.14","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","Edouard Manet (French, 18321883);;In the late 1860s, Edouard Manet was Claude Monet's hero. By 1874, they had become friends and Manet came under the sway of Monet's approach to painting quickly, out of doors. This portrait of the Monet familyCamille Monet and Jean, with Claude Monet gardening at the leftis one of Manet's most significant essays in this new style. In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: &quot;Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor painting of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'&quot; Renoir and Manet both gave their pictures to Monet.

He ignored still-life subjects during his yearlong hospital stay, but before leaving the artist brought his work in Saint-Remy full circle with four lush bouquets of spring flowers: two of roses and two of irises, in contrasting formats and color harmonies. Van Gogh noted that in the &quot;two canvases representing big bunches of violet irises,&quot; he placed &quot;one lot against a pink background&quot; and the other &quot;against a startling citron yellow background&quot; to exploit the play of &quot;disparate complementaries.&quot; Owing to the use of a fugitive red pigment, the &quot;soft and harmonious&quot; effect that he had sought in the Metropolitan's painting through the &quot;combination of greens, pinks, violets&quot; has been altered by the fading of the once pink background to almost white.

The Cairene almehs strikingly coloured costume of ballooning trousers and transparent blouse was noted by both Lane and Flaubert, who was describing his famous erotic encouter with the courtesan Kuchuk-Hanem in Egypt in 1850.2 Like Kuchuk-Hanem, Geromes Almeh (with pipe), here seen soliciting trade from the street, doubles as a prostitute. Geromes primary emphasis is on the seductiveness of the meticulously painted costume, artfully enhanced by the provocative pose. The almehs face and arms, one raised above her head and the other resting on her hip, are semi-concealed by dusky veils of green and black chiffon, leading the eye to dwell on the luminous skin exposed on her breasts. Her body inclines forward, with one slippered foot invitingly extended. The voluptuousness of her belly is emphasised by the trousers billowing out beneath the knot of fabric on the hips. The long pipe reinforces the message of languor and sensuousness. Gerome adds intrigue to a potentially obvious image by placing the model to one side of the stone doorway. This lures the imagination into the dark reaches of the passage behind her, where the shrouded figure of the procuress stands. This decrepit woman, and the broken patterned grille over the doorway above her, function as imitations of the material and moral decay that often haunted European fantasies of the Orient as a paradise of limitless erotic pleasure. ;;1.

In preparation, Peale traveled to the Princeton and Trenton battlefields in February of 1779 to make sketches for the background. The original portrait, the full-length version now in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (in Philadelphia), was a tremendous success and Peale completed numerous copies for royal palaces abroad, each time updating the general's military dress. This figure of George Washington was probably painted between June and August of 1780.

Havemeyer, 1929 (29.100.115);;In the summer of 1874, Manet was staying outside Paris at Gennevilliers, not far from the house in Argenteuil that he had found for the Monet family. He had refused to participate in the independent exhibition organized in the spring by the newly dubbed Impressionists. Nonetheless, Manet clearly wished to adopt the high-keyed palette, sketchlike brushwork, and subject matter centered on leisurely pursuits of his young colleagues. Boating is the manifesto of Manet's new allegiance to Impressionism.;;Manet's biographers recount that Rodolphe Leenhoff, the painter's brother-in-law, posed for the figure of the sailor. The simplicity of the composition and the use of broad planes of color accented by strong diagonals reveal Manet's admiration for Japanese color woodblock prints.;;The artist Mary Cassatt, who recommended this acquisition to the New York collectors Louisine and H.

In his pictures, one can chart the seasons, the weather, or as here, the look of women's fashion in 1873. Monet's wife, Camille Doncieux, is as easily recognizable as the mounds of geraniums in the garden of the couple's rented house in Argenteuil.;;Camille Monet on a Garden Bench is the most enigmatic of Monet's rare genre pictures. Numerous interpretations have been offered, yet nothing has been found in the literature or theater of Monet's time that corresponds to this scene. The most telling clue may be biographical: the death of Camille's father in September 1873. Camille was an impassive model, but here she telegraphs sadness, while holding a note in her gloved hand. Later, Monet identified the gentleman as a neighborperhaps one who had called to offer his condolences and a consoling bouquet.","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959640773.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959642223.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959644587.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959645665.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959655481.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959660257.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959663683.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959665559.jpg","-","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959669015.jpg","62.24","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","Oleanders, 1888;Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 18531890);Oil on canvas; 23 3/4 x 29 in.

(70.5 x 104.1 cm);Bequest of Sam A. Lewisohn, 1951 (51.112.6);;This painting is Seurat's final sketch for his masterpiece, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte (Art Institute of Chicago). The much larger, finished version was shown in the eighth Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Seurat analyzed the elements of his composition with nearly scientific care in at least thirty-two preparatory drawings and paintings. The scene depicted is an island in the Seine where working-class Parisians strolled, relaxed, and fished on Sundays. In a letter of 1890, Seurat states that he began work on the final canvas about August 15, 1884. In October 1885, he met Camille Pissarro and, following his advice, repainted the canvas using pigments that by 1892 had begun to lose their brilliance. The present study provides, therefore, a record of the chromatic intensity which the artist intended to achieve in the full-scale painting. As in the final work, the sketch juxtaposes contrasting pigments and depends on optical mixturethe phenomenon that causes two tones seen at a distance to form a single hueto create the desired effect. Seurat based his knowledge of the science of color on the technical treatises of M. E. Chevreul (Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colours, 1839) and Ogden N. Rood (Modern Chromatics, 1879). In this sketch, the pigments are woven together with small, patchy brushstrokes, while in the final painting Seurat used the small dots characteristic of his Pointillist technique. After the sketch was finished, he restretched the canvas and added the border at the edge.","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: europeanpaintings,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 08","6959745311.jpg","1992.374","A Day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","Shoes, 1888;Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 18531890);Oil on canvas; 18 x 21 3/4 in.

In depictions from the Old Kingdom tomb of Nefer, grapes are trod to the rhythm provided by clappers.

Gift, 2001 (2001.730);;This elegantly illuminated psalter opens with a handsome headpiece to the Book of Psalms (fol. 5r) with a bust of Christ at its center and, below the headpiece, an elaborate incipit letter formed by two birds, which may refer to Jesus' dual nature as both God and man. The late twelfth-century manuscript represents the tradition of &quot;aristocratic&quot; psalters produced in the Byzantine sphere before the fall of Constantinople to the Latin Crusaders in 1204. The many inscriptions in the text also make it representative of the liturgical works that remained within the Byzantine sphere after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. John Lowden has identified a hymn on folio 81r as written in a late fourteenth-century hand typical of the scribe Ioasaph (active 13601405/6) of the Hodegon Monastery in Constantinople. The inscription describing the execution of the Christian Nicholas Pazartzis in the Hippodrome in 1554 (fol. 83r) suggests that the manuscript remained in Constantinople for at least a century after the city's fall. An inscription on folio 4r records that the psalter was given &quot;to the most pious metropolitan of Ephesus Lord ... Anthimos in the island of Samos&quot; in 1639. Another, on folio 82r, demonstrates that it was still on Samos in 1672: having been &quot;presented by the holy sakellarios [treasurer] of Samos, the protopappas Lord John, successor of Lord Alexios, to the monastery of Prophet Elijah, [it was] rebound well, under the supervision of the present abbot of the said monastery, Joseph the hieromonk ...&quot; As these inscriptions demonstrate, the careful preservation of such works was one of the means by which the artistic traditions of the Byzantine era were preserved and transferred to the Orthodox faithful after the loss of the empire's political power.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cnst/ho_2001.730.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cnst/ho_2001.730.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: manuscript,ElissaSCA: book,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc,Artwork","Book_Manuscript""SET 08","2349130033.jpg","21.88.34","Silver Phiale with Gilding in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2007","ElissaSCA","Silver phiale (libation bowl) with gilding;Greek, 4th century BC;;Accession # 21.88.34;;The decoration of the exterior consists of a rosette surrounded by two series of silver and gilded petals.

The bracelets and necklace that she wears, the fillet in her hair, the ends of her scepter, and her libation bowl are rendered in added clay and were originally gilded. Like other cups of high quality with representations of deities on a white ground, this piece may have been specially commissioned for dedication at a sanctuary.;;The interior of the cup was covered with a white slip that gives even greater resonance to the painter's exquisite use of line and color than does the usual orange background on red-figure vases. The addition of a thin layer of very fine white clay to the surface of a vase was practiced in Athens from the late seventh century B.C. onward, enjoying a period of particular favor from the second quarter to the end of the fifth century B.C.

As one of the leading vase painters of the fifth century B.C., the Berlin Painter abandoned the rigid frames of panels on the amphora so that the contour of the vase itself focuses our attention on his solitary figures. On this particular vase, a musician in a long, slim garment accompanies himself on the kithara, a musical instrument used for formal performances in festivals and contests. The young musician, known as a kitharode, spreads the fingers of his left hand behind the strings and prepares to strike them with the plektron, or pick, in his right hand. The muscles in his neck stretch as he throws back his head and opens his mouth to sing. The sash below his kithara sways with the rhythm of his song. On the reverse side of the amphora, an instructor or, possibly, a judge listens intently and extends his right arm toward the young musician.;;The kithara was an instrument with seven strings of equal length and a solidly built, wooden body, usually with a flat base. Strings of gut or sinew were stretched from a holder at the base of the instrument over a bridge to the crossbar that joined the two sidepieces. The kitharode, who always stood while playing, made music by stroking the plektron in his right hand across the strings, sounding all those not damped with his left fingers. During performances, the instrument rested against the musician's shoulder, and was supported by a sling that wrapped around the left wrist. The musician could regulate pitch by the tension and, perhaps, thickness of the strings.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grmu/ho_56.171.38.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grmu/ho_56.171.38.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: amphora,ElissaSCA: berlinpainter,ElissaSCA: orange,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: redfigure,ElissaSCA: archaic,Art2or3,3D,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 08","2357583483.jpg","10.210.19","Terracotta Hydria with Achilles & Penthesilea by the Berlin Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2007","ElissaSCA","Terracotta hydria: kalpis (water jar);Greek, Attic, red-figure, ca. 500 BC;Attributed to the Berlin Painter;Achilles and Penthesilea;;Accession # 10.210.19;;Penthesilea, the queen of the Amazons who assisted the Trojans in the Trojan War, was killed by the Greek hero Achilles.

This crown is dominated by five diadem plaques and surmounted by a half-vajra. The dated inscription records that it was commissioned by two named devotees, to be worn on the occasion of the consecration of newly installed icons of Chakrasamvara and Heruka. The consecrations were performed by sri Bekhasi deva Vajracarya of Naka Bahica of OBaha, &quot;on Thursday, the 10th of the dark half of Bhadra, during the Pusya naksatra and the Siddha yoga&quot; (1717).

It is constructed of a Herakles knot and an openwork band decorated with ivy tendrils bearing leaves and berries. The leaves are delicately chased, and each group of three berries is soldered to a triangular pallet. Their stems are made of hammered and tapered solid-gold wire.;The knot is composed of inlaid garnets set between two large rectangular cabochons. Its design is enriched by a flowering plant bearing six gold blossoms and a whorl of leaves at its base. The large center leaf is represented by an emerald, and the lesser leaves were enameled in green, which survives on only one small leaf. Distal to the garnet cabochons are imbricated filigree bands with extensive traces of reddish purple (manganese), green, and possibly white enamel. According to the Roman writer Pliny, the decorative device of the Herakles knot could cure wounds, and its popularity in Hellenistic jewelry suggests that it was thought to have the power to avert evil.","branko_: greek,branko_: roman,branko_: galleries,branko_: branko,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: nyc,branko_: manhattan,branko_: metropolitan,branko_: museum,branko_: art,branko_: metropolitanmuseum,branko_: armband,branko_: with,branko_: herakles,branko_: knot,branko_: heracles,branko_: hercules,Art2or3,3D,jewelry,Artwork","Jewelry""SET 08","6959573929.jpg","16.1.3a, b","A Day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","Pectoral and Necklace of Sithathoryunet, Necklace, pectoral, Sithathoryunet, Senwosret II, ca. 18871813 B.C.; Middle Kingdom;Egyptian; Lahun; Fayum Entrance Area;Gold, carnelian, feldspar, garnet, turquoise, lapis lazuli; L. of necklace: 82 cm (32 5/16 in) H. of pectoral: 4.5 cm (1 3/4 in); w. 8.2 cm (3 1/4 in);Purchase, Rogers Fund and Henry Walters Gift, 1916 (16.1.3);;This pectoral is composed around the throne name of King Senwosret II. It was found among the jewelry of Princess Sit-hathor-yunet in a special niche of her underground tomb beside the pyramid of Senwosret II at Lahun. Hieroglyphic signs make up the design, and the whole may be read: &quot;The god of the rising sun grants life and dominion over all that the sun encircles for one million one hundred thousand years [i.e., eternity] to King Khakheperre [Senwosret II].&quot;;;This cloisonne pectoral is inlaid with 372 carefully cut pieces of semiprecious stones. The heraldic design is replete with symbolism. Zigzag lines on the base bar represent the primordial waters out of which the primeval hill emerged. Each of the falcons, symbols of the sun god, clasps a circular hieroglyph meaning &quot;encircled,&quot; thus declaring the solar deity's supreme power over the universe. The same hieroglyph, elongated to form a cartouche, encircles the throne name of Senwosret II, Khai-kheper-re. Flanking the king's name are two ankh hieroglyphs (meaning &quot;life&quot;) suspended from cobras whose tails are wound around the sun disk on the falcons' heads. These snakes represent Nekhbet and Udjo, the traditional protector goddesses of the king. Supporting the royal cartouche is the kneeling god Heh clutching two palm ribs symbolizing &quot;millions of years.&quot; Thus the king's life and existence in time are described as part of a universe created and sustained by the supreme sun god.;;Jewelry worn by royal women during the Middle Kingdom was simply for adornment or an indication of status but was also symbolic of concepts and myths surrounding Egyptian royalty. Jewelry imbued a royal woman with superhuman powers and thus enabled her to support the king in his role as guarantor of divine order on earth. It was essentially the king who benefited from the magical powers inherent in the jewelry worn by the female members of his family, which explains why his name, rather than that of the princess, appears in the designs.;;Since the tomb of the princess was beside the pyramid of Senwosret, scholars speculate that she was his daughter. Other items in the tomb bear the name of Amenemhat III, suggesting that the princess lived during the reigns of three of the most powerful rulers of Dynasty 12: Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org</a>  addl Pectoral and Necklace of Sithathoryunet with the Name of Senwosret II Date: ca. 1887–1878 B.C.

The king wears simple ovoid earrings and a beaded necklace of Sasanian fashion. His powerful stare and characteristic arched nose seem to suggest that the artist was attempting to convey a sense of majesty rather than an individual likeness. The identity of the subject of such representations, in relief or in the round, can often be determined by comparison of facial features and details of the crown with those of kings portrayed on Sasanian coins of the period. In this case, however, the crescent that decorates the crenellated crown and the striated orb that rises above it have no exact parallel. It does appear, however, on crowns worn by Kushano-Sasanian rulers.

The same pieces of bread which were consecrated to Ishtar in ancient Babylon.;Once you put it together, you'll realize that you just participated in a Babylonian rite of adoration to the sun god and to the queen of heaven. The iconography is exactly the same, the names of Jesus and Virgin Mary have been changed, just to fool you a little.   addl Reliquary Arm of St. Valentine Date: 14th century Medium: Silver, partial gilt, sapphire Accession Number: 17.190.351a, b On view in Gallery 306","branko_: arm,branko_: reliquary,branko_: metropolitan,branko_: museum,branko_: art,branko_: mma,branko_: manhattan,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: leica,branko_: m9,branko_: branko,branko_: metropolitanmuseum,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6528676801.jpg","-","Indigenous peoples of the Andes","branko_","American Museum of Natural History;; branko;<a href=http://www.a2b1.com rel=nofollow>www.a2b1.com</a>;youtube channel: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/a2b1 rel=nofollow>www.youtube.com/a2b1</a>","branko_: american,branko_: museum,branko_: natural,branko_: history,branko_: indigenous,branko_: peoples,branko_: andes,branko_: branko,branko_: leica,branko_: m9,branko_: new,branko_: york,branko_: city,branko_: nyc,branko_: manhattan,Art2or3,3D,Q,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6554647313.jpg","-","We met at the Met","Spodeworld",";;IMGP1881_ed-1 We met at the Met (Photivo + GIMP)","Spodeworld: pentaxk20d,Spodeworld: pentaxa50mmf14,Spodeworld: metropolitanmuseum,Spodeworld: met,Spodeworld: newyork,Spodeworld: pentax,Spodeworld: manuallens,Spodeworld: photivo,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6739666783.jpg","-","-","-","-","Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6739667065.jpg","-","2012 - 01 - 07 - Manly Man","Mississippi Snopes","Herakles (I think).","Mississippi Snopes: metropolitanmuseum,Mississippi Snopes: newyorkcity,Mississippi Snopes: grecoromancollection,Mississippi Snopes: marble,Mississippi Snopes: statue,Mississippi Snopes: sexy,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6763822123.jpg","89.4.1163","Figural Bell in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 2010","ElissaSCA","Figural Bell;Cast brass;Nuremburg, 19th century;Accession Number: 89.4.1163;;This bell takes the form of an elegant eighteenth century French woman, perhaps Madame de Pompadour. ;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bell,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: german,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,Art2or3,3D,AccessionInDesc,Description,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6773613232.jpg","1988.392","Samvara and Consort in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 2010","ElissaSCA","Samvara and Consort;;Date: ca. 12th century ;;Culture: India (Bengal) or Bangladesh ;;Medium: Phyllite ;;Dimensions: H. 5 in.

By the thirteenth century these barriers often were decorated with extensive narrative themes, especially the Passion, the dramatic final events in the earthly life of Jesus. Because they hindered participation in church rituals by the laity, most European churches eventually eliminated them. The choir screen at the cathedral in Amiens was destroyed in 1755.

As recounted in the epic Ramayana, the courage and loyalty of Hanuman make him the supreme example of those virtues. In Chola bronze sculpture, Hanuman is almost always depicted standing and bent slightly forward, as if in obeisance before Rama. He is usually part of a larger group that includes Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and his wife Sita.;;Standing on a double-lotus pedestal on a tiered base, Hanuman is shown in graceful contrapposto, his left leg bent and the weight of his body resting on his rigid right leg. He leans forward and gestures as though engrossed in conversation. Except for his thick tail and simian face, he is represented as human. Hanuman is dressed in a dhoti and wears a crown and the usual jewelry of the period. The sacred thread is worn diagonally across his chest.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1982.220.9 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1982.220.9</a>","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: asianart,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6813419406.jpg","-","A Day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: asianart,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6813420334.jpg","-","A Day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: asianart,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6813421320.jpg","-","A Day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","NA","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: asianart,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6813423716.jpg","68.46","A Day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","Stela of a Four-Armed Vishnu;India (Punjab), 10th-11th century;Sandstone;;Accession # 68.46;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: asianart,Art2or3,3D,AccessionInDesc,Description,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6813427068.jpg","05.12","A Day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","Primo Iglesias","Artist: William Henry Rinehart (18251874);;Title: Latona and Her Children, Apollo and Diana;;Date: 1870; this version, 1874;;Medium: Marble;;Dimensions: 46 1/8 x 65 3/4 x 31 in., 2795lb.

His tomb was a great shaft over sixty feet deep sunk into the desert and solid limestone bedrock in the Late Period cemetery that covers most of the area east of the Djoser complex at Saqqara. In a huge plain chamber at the bottom of the shaft, a rectangular rock core was left standing and hollowed out to house this anthropoid sarcophagus. When the tomb was excavated by the Egyptian government in 1902, the sarcophagus contained the remains of a badly decomposed gilded cedar coffin, and a mummy that wore a mask of gilded silver, gold finger and toe stalls, and numerous small amulets. Other canopic and shabti equipment accompanied the burial. The finds went to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, while this sarcophagus was purchased from the Egyptian government by the Metropolitan Museum.;The sarcophagus is one of a group with plump, squarish broad faces, smooth unarticulated bodies, and slightly protruding feet that all originate in the Memphite area and date to the time around the reign of Psamtik II (ca. 595589 B.C.); several of them may have been produced by the same workshop. Technically the sarcophagus is one of the masterpieces of late Egyptian hard-stone carving. The interiors of the extraordinarily rendered sunk-relief hieroglyphs and figures were left rough and may have been intended to be painted, perhaps in green. The long text on the lid comes from the Book of the Dead.  addl Sarcophagus of Harkhebit Date: 664–525 B.C.

Polsky, 1982 (1982.220.8);;Krishna, whose legend is told in Books Ten and Eleven of the great Hindu epic, the Bhagavata Purana, was threatened as a baby by the wicked tyrant Kamsa. To protect him, his parents, Vevaki and Vasudeva, hid him with a cowherd and his wife Yashoda. Krishna survived to become the hero of many well-loved stories, and is often represented as a young man or as a mischievous child.;;Depictions of Yashoda holding her foster son Krishna are rare, especially in sculptural form. In this example, she is shown nursing the infant god, cradling his head with one hand while the other gathers him close. Yashoda's direct gaze makes this intimate and tender portrayal somewhat iconic.;;The style and iconography of this sculpture suggest a provenance in the southern part of the subcontinent. However, the lack of precise stylistic parallels make dating difficult, and the current cataloguing in the fourteenth century remains tentative.;;;Text from: <a

Although otherwise nude, she wears elaborate accessories, including an exaggerated calathos (the crown of Egyptian Greco-Roman deities) emblazoned with the sun disk and horns of Isis. Her long corkscrew curls are arranged in the semblance of a traditional Egyptian hairstyle.;;Similarly garbed figures of goddesses and female figures associated with marriage, conception, and childbirth are found throughout the Greco-Roman world. The Egyptian version is distinguished by its compressed, frontal, and rather rigidly upright pose, and by its occurrence in burials. These features relate to pharaonic prototypes whose efficacy seems to have extended into the afterlife for women and men alike.;;After being formed in a two-part mold, the front of the hollow figurine was dipped in a white engobe (slip), then painted with a white base coat and detailed in stark black, yellow, and a range of reds and pinks, even to an elusive blush over the cheeks.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/afe/hod_1991.76.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/afe/hod_1991.76.htm</a>","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: egyptianart,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6971741945.jpg","56.26","Bust of Francesco Bocchetta by Alessandro Vittoria in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2011","ElissaSCA","FRANCESCO BOCCHETTA;;Workshop of Alessandro Vittoria (Alessandro Vittoria di Vigilio della Volpa) (Italian, 15251608); ;Date: ca. 156590 ;;Culture: Italian (Venice) ;;Medium: Marble ;;Dimensions: H. 30 in.

He is in turn complemented by his beautiful wife, Gu, and his wild, grotesque brother, Zuali. Such representations are owned by certain families that use them as the loci of sacrificial offerings proposed by diviners to improve their well-being.

(49.5 cm);Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, 1991 (1991.76);;This tall, sensuously modeled and delicately painted terracotta figurine represents Aphrodite-Isis, a goddess combining attributes of the Egyptian goddesses Isis and Hathor and the Greek goddess Aphrodite. Although otherwise nude, she wears elaborate accessories, including an exaggerated calathos (the crown of Egyptian Greco-Roman deities) emblazoned with the sun disk and horns of Isis. Her long corkscrew curls are arranged in the semblance of a traditional Egyptian hairstyle.;;Similarly garbed figures of goddesses and female figures associated with marriage, conception, and childbirth are found throughout the Greco-Roman world. The Egyptian version is distinguished by its compressed, frontal, and rather rigidly upright pose, and by its occurrence in burials. These features relate to pharaonic prototypes whose efficacy seems to have extended into the afterlife for women and men alike.;;After being formed in a two-part mold, the front of the hollow figurine was dipped in a white engobe (slip), then painted with a white base coat and detailed in stark black, yellow, and a range of reds and pinks, even to an elusive blush over the cheeks.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/afe/hod_1991.76.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/afe/hod_1991.76.htm</a>","Primo Iglesias: themetropolitanmuseumofart,Primo Iglesias: metropolitan,Primo Iglesias: museum,Primo Iglesias: art,Primo Iglesias: metropolitanmuseum,Primo Iglesias: newyorkcity,Primo Iglesias: themet,Primo Iglesias: fineart,Primo Iglesias: gotham,Primo Iglesias: nyc,Primo Iglesias: 5thavenue,Primo Iglesias: uppereastside,Primo Iglesias: worksofart,Primo Iglesias: egyptianart,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 08","6894561979.jpg","1984.190","Dog Skull","Joe Josephs: 1,355,720 views - thank you","Michael C.
