Ah, such a shocker. I was definitely WOWed by the huge-ness of the museum... I am just speechless.;Anyway, I love color schemes and the simpleness of this photo easily lured me in to choosing it as my photo of the day. Many more to come on tumblr, which I should definitely get on ASAP!;Btw, Thieny found this photography contest on tumblr (thank you)... and it sounds really awesome :) maybe I'll look into it, no?;;Day/morning started by waking up at 3am to get in line at the Rockefeller Plaza for the free Maroon 5 concert taping for The Today Show. Wait and all that jazz was very similar to that of the Alicia Keys concert, but the venue was different (less inclusive of the audience) and the waiting periods were awkwardly long. Sound check went well and almost even better than the actual performance. There were quite a few rude people... but I guess everyone was getting grumpy due to sleep deprivation and all sorts of other things. Next week is Lady Gaga for The Today Show (which I am not going to) and the American Idol Season 9 (?) Top 10 concert for Good Morning, America (which I will most likely be going to). I am very sad that I missed Mary J. Blige... but this morning was awesome so I don't regret any of it!;;After concert, Allegra Kaori Thieny Cynthia Carmina Dani and I went to &quot;Variety Cafe&quot; to get some quick breakfast... then walked Thieny and Cynthia to the subway station while the rest of us went to get more/better breakfast at MickeyDs. Hash browns ftw.;;Soon after, we headed to The Met, which is when I began my &quot;photo shoot&quot; for the photography contest. We entered the big building, got lost a couple of times... visited Egypt, admired Picasso, wondered with J. Pollock, and (I, at least) fell in love with the modern photography.;I think photography is just one of those things that you can do anytime, anywhere... and one photo that is worth less than a penny to you is another photo that someone else would die for.;THAT IS ART.;I am definitely planning on going back to The Met again to spend more time actually absorbing all that there is! Also to go back to Central Park for the row boats and the zoo since we didn't do that today... and why didn't we do all that after a long morning? we were tired?? no way...;;Thieny called me to tell me she got two free $50 NY Yankee tickets for today at 1pm. I also bought tickets with Byanca and the other girls for the game tomorrow... but since this was free, I managed to find someone to sell my ticket to for tomorrow's game... and in the spur of the moment, went with Thieny to the Yankee Stadium in The Bronx (a new borough for me!) to enjoy a nice &quot;CA weather day&quot; at the stadium.;We met this man and his son (Tommy and Brenden - I love the sons name!) who were just so precious and the kid was really adorable... tiny in size but I can tell he will make it big and far in no time!;These are the types of New Yorkers I like to interact with... not the stubborn, rude, accusing types that are starting to appear as trends in my everyday life! Hopefully everyone will soon enough, learn to take a chill pill and enjoy each others company, laugh about the silly mistakes, cherish all the best moments together... never alone!;;Mind that all this was happening... and I was awake from 3am on maybe 2 or 3 hours of sleep. Good stuff... I love spending my time wisely :);;Got back from the game (Yankees lost to the Toronto Blue Jays at the end... but hopefully they kick but tomorrow!), chilled a bit and got ready for dinner (5 mins max? haha. not a typical girl...);Thieny Dani Amy Carmina and I went to Joe's Shanghai and had some of the best Chinese food I have had in a very long time. Oh! I bought figs again! four days straight, except Chinatown was much cheaper haha.;Picked up Amy's friend, Sam, who cam over from Boston for the weekend... we all tried to find boba but I think we were too full to try a little harder than we did...;so off to home we went.;;Now I am here, about to write 11+ more postcards... and post pic","love today photography: timewemet2010,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 27","4757209007.jpg","-","I'm bad, I'm bad...","love today photography","you know it!;Such a thriller.;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art;July 2, 2010.","love today photography: timewemet2010,Description,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 27","4757221401.jpg","-","My very own piece of artwork!","love today photography","until we found out that child IS A BOY!;No sexism allowed :);;;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art;July 25, 2010.","love today photography: timewemet2010,The Metropolitan Museum of Art: mma:itwm2010=accepted,Description,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 27","4761634306.jpg","-","-","-","-","2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 27","4766420738.jpg","-","NA","NA","CJKissel","CJKissel: timewemet2010,CJKissel: themetropolitanmuseumofart,The Metropolitan Museum of Art: mma:itwm2010=accepted,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 27","4770739463.jpg","-","Le joueur de Luth","Le Caravage (1571-1610), vers 1597.

By the middle of the eighteenth century these rules were being circumvented by a class of entrepreneurs, known as marchand-merciers, who were able to obtain parts from various sources that could be combined in a single object. One of the most successful marchand-merciers was Lazare Duvaux, who held the title of merchant-jeweler to the French king from 1748 to 1758. Gudin le Jeune was among the clockmakers who supplied movements for clocks of this variety, and there is at least one payment in Duvaux's records from Gudin in 1753 for a Meissen porcelain group. It is not the group found on this clock, however, which has a complicated history of its own; it is composed of a group called the Hand Kiss and a separate figure titled Shindler, the Huzzar of Count Heinrich von Bruhl. Both porcelains were modeled at Meissen by Johann Joachim Kaendler (1706-1775) between 1735 and 1737, and the Hand Kiss appeared in several versions, one in which a tea table replaces the cavalier. On this clock the porcelain group is mounted on an exuberantly rococo French gilded-bronze that also supports the stem of a bush laden with flowers (made about 1745-49) at the French porcelain manufactory at Vincennes) encircling the dial of the clock.

Amitayus is shown cradling a jar containing the elixir of immortality in his lap as he preaches to an assemblage of Bodhisattvas (beings who have reached enlightenment but remain earthbound to save mankind) in his heaven. He is flanked by two Bodhisattvas standing on a gentle tribhanga (thrice-bent posture) typical of Indian Art and two tiers of seated Bodhisattvas, all of whom receive his doctrine. The seven figures in the upper register may be Buddhist hierarchs; they wear long-sleeved undergarments, voluminous cloaks, and flat hats, characteristics of eleventh-century Tibetan costume. At the bottom left are two figures, probably the donors of the painting, and on the right is a monk in monastic costume, who possiblly consecrated the thanka (painting on cloth). The monumental volumes of the deities and the slightly naÔve rendering of the subsidiary figures are typical of this early phase of Tibetan thankas.    Rogers Fund, 1989 (1989.284)      **  The <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/'>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.  It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/'>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold.  As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.    In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.    The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.  The interior was designated in 1977.

Michael Paul Foundation Inc. Gift and Charles Ulrick and Josephine Bay Foundation Inc. Gift, and Fletcher Fund, 1967 (67.250);;Dante's Divine Comedy has always enjoyed favor in the plastic arts. Ugolino, the character that galvanized peoples' fantasies and fears during the second half of the nineteenth century, appears in Canto 33 of the Inferno. This intensely Romantic sculpture derives from the passage in which Dante describes the imprisonment in 1288 and subsequent death by starvation of the Pisan count Ugolino della Gherardesca and his offspring. Carpeaux depicts the moment when Ugolino, condemned to die of starvation, yields to the temptation to devour his children and grandchildren, who cry out to him:;;But when to our somber cell was thrown;A slender ray, and each face was lit;I saw in each the aspect of my own,;For very grief both of my hands I bit,;And suddenly from the floor arising they,;Thinking my hunger was the cause of it,;Exclaimed: Father eat thou of us, and stay;Our suffering: thou didst our being dress;In this sad flesh; now strip it all away.;;Carpeaux's visionary composition reflects his reverence for Michelangelo, as well as his own painstaking concern with anatomical realism. Ugolino and His Sons was completed in plaster in 1861, the last year of his residence at the French Academy in Rome. A sensation in Rome, it brought Carpeaux many commissions. Upon his return to France, Ugolino was cast in bronze at the order of the French Ministry of Fine Arts and exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1863. Later it was moved to the gardens of the Tuilieries, where it was displayed as a pendant to a bronze of the Laocoon. This marble version was executed by the practitioner Bernard under Carpeaux's supervision and completed in time for the Universal Exposition at Paris in 1867. The date inscribed on the marble refers to the original plaster model's completion;;Source: Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux: Ugolino and His Sons (67.250) | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art;  addl accession","Stephen Sandoval: themet,Stephen Sandoval: multipleexposure,Stephen Sandoval: metropolitanmuseumofart,Stephen Sandoval: ugolinoandhissons,Description,Stylized,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 27","4761621252.jpg","-","The fat and the lean","Westsideguy","NA","Westsideguy: humor,Westsideguy: sculpture,Westsideguy: giacometti,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 27","4761988577.jpg","-","-","-","-","3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 27","4762238197.jpg","-","The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Alex E.

The king's figure was considerably smaller than that of the god, indicating his subordinate status in the presence of the deity. All that remains of Amun is his right hand, which touches the back of the king's crown in a gesture that signifies Tutankhamun's investiture as king. During coronation rituals, various types of crowns were put on the king's head. The type represented hereprobably a leather helmet with metal disks sewn onto itwas generally painted blue, and is commonly called the &quot;blue crown.&quot; The ancient name was &quot;khepresh.&quot;;Statue groups showing a king together with gods had been created since the Old Kingdom, and formal groups relating to the pharaoh's coronation were dedicated at Karnak by Hatshepsut and other rulers of Dynasty 18. The Metropolitan's head of Tutankhamun with the hand of Amun is special because of the intimacy with which the subject is treated. The face of the king expresses a touching youthful earnestness, and the hand of the god is raised toward his crown with gentle care.;ProvenancePurchased in New York from Charles D.

It is decorated in high relief with sacrificial animals and religious objects, packed tightly on a stippled background within the rectangular frame. Featured prominently are the heads of three domestic animalsa ram, a bull, and a goatthat were commonly used as offerings at major public ceremonies. Below them are two more sacrificial animals, a rooster and a kid with its legs bound, together with a sheathed knife, a libation bowl, a burning torch, a pomegranate, a floral garland, and a bundle of wooden staves. Such elaborate and symbolic decoration strongly suggests that the box to which the lid belonged had some religious function. The decoration is unusual but not unique; another lid in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (attached to an ancient but alien silver box) has a very similar design, though there the projecting horn of the bull's head serves as the only handle to the lid.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.26 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.26</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: silver,ElissaSCA: lid,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 27","4812976539.jpg","19.192.5","Terracotta Statuette of an Old Nurse and Child in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, June 2010","ElissaSCA","Terracotta Statuette of an Old Nurse and Child;Greek, Boeotian, 4th-3rd century BC;;Accession # 19.192.5;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum Of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: figurine,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 27","4812976549.jpg","12.232.11","South Italian Terracotta Statuette of Aphrodite and Eros in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, June 2010","ElissaSCA","Terracotta Statuette of Aphrodite and Eros;Greek, South Italian, 3rd century BC;;Accession # 12.232.11;;In Greek mythology, Eros is the son of the goddess Aphrodite and her lover Ares, god of war.
