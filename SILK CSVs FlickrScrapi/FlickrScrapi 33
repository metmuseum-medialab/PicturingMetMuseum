Here, using sharp tonal contrasts of ink and white paper, Xu's swift rendition of this noble steel embodies the spirit of a tradition &quot;ink play.&quot; The horse's naturalistic pose is deftly captured in abbreviated brushwork. The chiaroscuro modeling of its form is more subjective than scientific, but the horse's accurate anatomy and the convincing foreshortening of its body reflect Xu's solid grounding in Western academic art. The hauteur of the unleashed, unmounted animal is essentially Western in character, whereas its mane and tail, blowing unnaturally in opposite directions, attests to the artist's ultimately subjective (Chinese) approach.;;Xu's passionate images of horses, a traditional symbol of Chinese martial spirit, were intended to inspire patriotic resistance during the Sino-Japanese War. Here, for example, the artist reveals his own sense of frustration by adding a poem by Du Fu (712-770) that describes a famous breed of war horses that had been put to pasture because of their old age despite their continued willingness to fight:;;<i>Nanshi [in Gansu province] is a congenial habitat for heavenly horses;;Tens of thousands of them are always stalwart.;Floating clouds expand across the vast frontier;;Autumn grasses grow tall over the mountains;I have heard that the pure bloodline of dragon horses;Lives on in the aging Sushuang horse.;Neighing sadly longing to fight,;It stands tall facing the sky.</i>;;Partial and Promised Gift of Richard M.

Its figure style is influenced by Leonardo da Vinci as well as by Northern artists, especially Joos van Cleve and Lucas Cranach.;;The subject itself, the rather gruesome one of the executioner placing the Baptist's head in a salver for the waiting Salome, was popular among Leonardo's followers, and many of the Milanese paintings of Salome probably derive from a lost composition by the master. These paintings depict the moment in the Gospel of Mark (6:2128) when the young Salome, daughter of Herod's wife Herodias, is granted her wish to have John the Baptist executed. Although this theme has been painted by numerous artistswith both full- and half-length figuresit is rare for the executioner to be so severely cropped that we see only his outstretched arm. This arm, with its clenched fist and rough drapery, is an unsettling synecdoche for the man as a whole.;;Conspicuously signed in the lower right corner, the Salome is one of Solario's finest paintings and is completely characteristic of his style. It is worked up to a high finish, with some astonishing effects: the reflections and sheen of the silver basin, the transparent bodice of Salome's dress, the delicacy of description of the Baptist's head, and the marbling of the parapet.

Seeking wives to found families, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring Sabines, who refused to allow their woman to marry Romans for fear of a rival culture. Faced with the extinction of their communicty, Romulus invited the Sabines to a festival of Neptune Equester. At the meeting Romulus raised his cloak as a prearranged signal for the warriors to seize the women. According to Livy no sexual assault took place. On the contrary, Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights. The women accepted Roman husbands, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. During the Renaissance the subject was popular as a story symbolising the central importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures.;;Poussin depicts Romulus, at the left, giving the signal for the abduction. The mother, her babies, and an old woman in the foreground were captured accidentally in the turmoil.

Sargent probably met her in 1881. In 1882, he wrote of wanting to paint her portrait. He worked on the portrait at the Gautreau's summer home in Brittany in 1883, but he had difficulty finding a suitable pose and perspective. Numerous studies show his different attempts at the composition. The portrait as finally executed was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1884 as &quot;Portrait de Mme ***&quot; and created a scandal.

These works, which were based on photographs, were factually rendered but magnified every pore and imperfection to unexpected and unnatural proportions. The subjects for all of Close's portraits are drawn from his wide circle of relatives and friends, many of whom are connected to the art world as artists, dealers, and collectors. Their identification in the titles by their first names only lends a casual informality to otherwise imposing images.;;Paintings such as &quot;Lucas,&quot; which depicts fellow artist Lucas Samaras, are representative of Close's later, more colorful and painterly style. They go beyond the hyper-reality of his earlier portraits and elaborate on his pictorial investigation of the act of perception, breaking down the visual information into component parts that describe the actual process of seeing, not just the end result. To create these portraits, Close begins by taking photographs of the sitter, then draws a grid over the photo, from which he methodically reproduces the contents of each tiny square on a magnified scale with small dashes, dots of pigment, thumbprints, or applied pieces of colored paper. Viewed close-up, the elements of the picture are seen as separate abstract markings; from a distance, they coalesce into an illusionistic portrait.

These works, which were based on photographs, were factually rendered but magnified every pore and imperfection to unexpected and unnatural proportions. The subjects for all of Close's portraits are drawn from his wide circle of relatives and friends, many of whom are connected to the art world as artists, dealers, and collectors. Their identification in the titles by their first names only lends a casual informality to otherwise imposing images.;;Paintings such as &quot;Lucas,&quot; which depicts fellow artist Lucas Samaras, are representative of Close's later, more colorful and painterly style. They go beyond the hyper-reality of his earlier portraits and elaborate on his pictorial investigation of the act of perception, breaking down the visual information into component parts that describe the actual process of seeing, not just the end result. To create these portraits, Close begins by taking photographs of the sitter, then draws a grid over the photo, from which he methodically reproduces the contents of each tiny square on a magnified scale with small dashes, dots of pigment, thumbprints, or applied pieces of colored paper. Viewed close-up, the elements of the picture are seen as separate abstract markings; from a distance, they coalesce into an illusionistic portrait. In order to assimilate all of the multi-hued daubs of color on an eight-foot-plus canvas, the viewer is forced to stand quite a distance from the work.

His stylizing brush wiped away the earlier round-cheeked youthfulness of the face, replacing it with a masklike expression of savy cunning.

Schoenborn, 1995 (1996.403.4);;Although never an official member of the Surrealists, despite Breton's efforts to coopt him, Picasso nevertheless participated in many of their exhibitions and activities in Paris. His work between 1926 and 1939 has been called surrealist because of its fanciful imagery and sexually charged motifs, but despite many shared features, Picasso's desire to interpret the real world was at odds with Surrealism's imaginary inner-generated visions. Here, he was inspired by bathers on a beach that he had previously sketched, painted, and sculpted in Cannes (1927) and Dinard (1928). In these earlier works, as in this 1929 painting, Picasso ultimately transforms the human figure into a strange mutated being, part geometric masonry, part inflated balloon. The features of the female physique metamorphose into one anotherthe rounded buttocks also suggesting breasts, the pointed breasts suggesting sharp teeth, and the horizontal slit, a reference to both navel and genitals. The overall effect is conflicted, showing both monumentality and vulnerability, sensuality and cold detachment, as if two different sensibilities inhabit this figure. Such imagery may have been a reflection of the artist's own anguished love life at the time. Married to Olga Khokhlova since 1918, he had been having an affair with a beautiful young teenager, Marie-Therese Walter, since the summer of 1927, which would last through the 1930s.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/pica/ho_1996.403.4.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/pica/ho_1996.403.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: spanish,ElissaSCA: picasso,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: abstract,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","2915894024.jpg","1999.363.58","Girl in Profile by Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Pablo Picasso.

During the early part of his career, he lived in Paris, where he was associated with the French Surrealists and its practitioners, but he returned to settle in Spain after World War II. This deliberate remove from the center of the art world is symptomatic of Miro's independence, a temperament that would mark his art as well as his life. Mining the possibilities of free invention encouraged by Surrealism, Miro developed a style that drew from highly personalized and psychological references. Often beginning with a recognizable starting point, Miro transformed his subjects through whimsical color and free play with form.;;The Potato is emblematic of Miro's poetic riffs on reality. It takes as its subject a gigantic female figure who stretches her arms wide, against a blue sky and above a patch of earthperhaps a potato field. The billowing white shape of the figure is attached to a red post in the center of the composition like a scarecrow on a pole. Miro surrounded his merry &quot;potato-earth-woman&quot; with fanciful decorative objects, some of which are &quot;earthy&quot; and some not. The figure has one brown-and-black breast that &quot;squirts&quot; a long, black, winding thread, as elfin creatures flutter in the sky around her. At the left, a red and yellow &quot;butterfly-woman&quot; takes flight from her brown banana-like nose as other creatures climb a ladderone of Miro's favorite motifs. Beyond the earthiness of the subject, the painting's title appears to be derived from the representation of an actual, recognizable potatothe small, brown, oval object with three tendrils growing out of its upper edge, which is lodged in the woman's forehead.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eusi/ho_1999.363.50.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eusi/ho_1999.363.50.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: spanish,ElissaSCA: surrealism,ElissaSCA: miro,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3022061168.jpg","49.59.1","The Figure Five in Gold by Charles Demuth in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","The Figure 5 in Gold, 1928;Charles Demuth (American, 18831935);Oil on cardboard; 35 1/2 x 30 in.

Williams' poem &quot;The Great Figure&quot; describes the experience of seeing a red fire engine with the number 5 painted on it racing through the city streets. While Demuth's painting is not an exact illustration of the poem, we can certainly sense its &quot;rain/and lights&quot; and the &quot;gong clangs/siren howls/and wheels rumbling.&quot;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/11/na/ho_49.59.1.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/11/na/ho_49.59.1.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,DescriptionInDesc,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3505204289.jpg","-","OccupiedBenches_TheMET(15)","rverc","Gallery 803 - Corot;;Part of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art;<a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/galleries/ncmc/803 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/collections/galleries/ncmc/803</a>","rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: europeanpaintings,rverc: art,rverc: met,rverc: nyc,rverc: camillecorot,rverc: corot,rverc: sirjohneverettmillais,rverc: portia,rverc: bench15,2D,Art2or3,Inhabited,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3809733447.jpg","-","Le Printemps","Jettaknight","Pierre-Auguste Cot (French, 1837-1883);1873;Metropolitan Museum of Art, NYC","Jettaknight: 2007,Jettaknight: nikond70s,Jettaknight: nyc,Jettaknight: museum,Jettaknight: metropolitanmuseum,Description,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3841926106.jpg","-","3.365","Isabel Tipton Photo","This really cool painting thing that was made layering wax.

Humphreys's portrait must have been commissioned by Wilson Braddyll, his manager and promoter, in anticipation of a well-publicized match against Daniel Mendoza, which was to take place on January 9, 1788. The portrait was engraved by John Young in a large folio mezzotint published on January 3.

(99.1 x 80 cm);Rogers Fund, 1951; acquired from The Museum of Modern Art, Lillie P. Bliss Collection (53.140.4);;Picasso's Woman in White is a masterpiece of his Neoclassical Period, which lasted from 1918 to 1925. Here, the artist depicts a seated figure as a dreamlike vision of fragile perfection and refinement. He achieves this effect through the application of several layers of white wash and superimposed contours in soft shades of brown and gray. As in many of his other figures of the period, the idealized treatment of her facial features reflects Picasso's study of classical art. Her informal pose, along with the loose-fitting, almost diaphanous dress, gives the figure a gentle and relaxed air. The muted color scheme adds a romantic and pensive tone.;;Although the model was always thought to be the artist's Russian wife Olga Khokhlova, it has recently been suggested that Picasso's muse was actually an American beauty, Sara Murphy, wife of the painter Gerald Murphy, with whom Picasso was infatuated between 1921 and 1924. The Murphys were a wealthy expatriate couple living in Paris in the 1920s, and their unconventional lifestyle attracted a circle of artists and writers including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Picasso and Olga met them in the fall of 1921, and the two families remained close over the next two summers, vacationing together in 1923.;;We may never know the true identity of the sitter, but since Picasso frequently fused the features of different people into a single idealized portrait, it is possible that this is just such a case. If so, the features of Olga and Sara are integrated here into a masterful and striking composition, full of tenderness and classical beauty.","Maulleigh: woman,Maulleigh: white,Maulleigh: pablo,Maulleigh: picasso,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3879015787.jpg","-","TheWeddingOfStephenBeckinghamAndMaryCox_TheMET (11)","rverc","Detail from: 'The Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox' William Hogarth 1729;;<b><a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/songoftheday/>Song of the Day<a rel=nofollow></a></a></b>;;Going To The Chapel Of Love- The Dixie Cups;;<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMfrLFirGWc rel=nofollow>www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMfrLFirGWc</a>;;","rverc: art,rverc: nyc,rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: europeanpaintings,rverc: bench143,rverc: williamhogarth,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3879479913.jpg","-","Exhibit Hall HDR","redsox223","NA","redsox223: nikon,redsox223: digital,redsox223: 40x,redsox223: metropolitanmuseumorart,redsox223: newyorkcity,redsox223: nyc,redsox223: art,redsox223: exhibit,redsox223: hall,redsox223: gallery,redsox223: bench,redsox223: empty,redsox223: hdr,redsox223: edited,redsox223: geo:lat=40778917,redsox223: geo:lon=73963137,redsox223: geotagged,hommik: aplusphoto,Dave_B_: delete,Oleksandr Photography: delete2,Mo Tabesh: delete3,Marc Evans Photography: delete4,nashtad: delete5,Colusite: delete6,Ventri: delete7,johnny onion: delete8,gdiazdeleon: delete9,kschimmel: delete10,PeinLee: delete11,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 33","3882080695.jpg","06.1328","Portia_TheMET (4)","rverc","Detail from: Portia Sir John Everett Millais British, 1829 1896;Oil on canvas Signed and dated (lower right): JEM(monogram)/ 1886;;This picture by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Millais was long misidentified as a portrait of the actress Ellen Terry (1847-1928) in one of her most famous roles, Portia in Shakespeares Merchant of Venice .

Amphorae have a distinctive, practical shape usually a narrow neck that could be sealed during transportation, two handles for ease of lifting and carrying by hand (as, for example, during the loading or unloading of a ship), and a rounded or cylindrical body with a pointed base to allow them to be stacked in multiple rows.;;An idea of the amount of produce that was imported to feed the inhabitants of Rome is given by Monte Testaccio, a man-made hill of discarded amphorae on the outskirts of the ancient city near the Tiber River, where the jars were unloaded and their contents transferred to smaller containers. Most of the surface shards on Monte Testaccio belong to a specific type of amphora known as Dressel 20, which was used to bring olive oil from Baetica in southern Spain.;;Amphorae remained in use until the end of antiquity, but the severe decline in trade throughout the Mediterranean in the seventh century AD put an end to the mass production of both contents and containers.

(17 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1954 (54.3.3);;Horn-shaped vessels ending in an animal's head have a long history in the Near East as well as in Greece and Italy. Early Iranian examples are straight, with the cup and animal head on the same plane. Later, in the Achaemenid period, the head, or animal protome, was often placed at a right angle to the cup, as in this piece. In the manufacture of this gold vessel, several parts were invisibly joined by brazing, which demonstrates superb technical skill. The upper band of the vessel is decorated with 136 feet of twisted wire in 44 even rows, and the roof of the lion's mouth is raised in tiny ribs.

However, lifesize bronzes are a rarity in modern collections because they were routinely melted down in the Middle Ages for their inherent metallic value.

(313.7 cm);Gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr., 1932 (32.143.1.2);;From the ninth to the seventh century B.C., the kings of Assyria ruled over a vast empire centered in northern Iraq. The great Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883859 B.C.) undertook a vast building program at Nimrud, ancient Kalhu. Until it became the capital city under Ashurnasirpal, Nimrud had been no more than a provincial town.;;The new capital occupied an area of about nine hundred acres, around which Ashurnasirpal constructed a mudbrick wall that was 120 feet thick, 42 feet high, and five miles long. In the southwest corner of this enclosure was the acropolis, where the temples, palaces, and administrative offices of the empire were located. In 879 B.C. Ashurnasirpal held a festival for 69,574 people to celebrate the construction of the new capital, and the event was documented by an inscription that read: &quot;...the happy people of all the lands together with the people of Kalhufor ten days I feasted, wined, bathed, and honored them and sent them back to their home in peace and joy.&quot;;;The so-called Standard Inscription that ran across the surface of most of the reliefs described Ashurnasirpal's palace: &quot;I built thereon [a palace with] halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, teak, terebinth, and tamarisk [?] as my royal dwelling and for the enduring leisure life of my lordship.&quot; The inscription continues: &quot;Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made it [the palace] fittingly imposing.&quot; Such limestone beasts are the human-headed, winged bull and lion pictured here. The horned cap attests to their divinity, and the belt signifies their power. The sculptor gave these guardian figures five legs so that they appear to be standing firmly when viewed from the front but striding forward when seen from the side. These lamassu protected and supported important doorways in Assyrian palaces.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/ancient_near_eastern_art/human_headed_winged_bull_and_winged_lion_lamassu/objectview.aspx?page=9&amp;sort=5&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=1&amp;dd1=3&amp;dd2=24&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=24&amp;OID=30009052&amp;vT=2>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/ancien...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: mesopotamia,ElissaSCA: assyrian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: lamassu,ElissaSCA: monster,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,DescriptionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 33","2783754847.jpg","21.88.65","South Italian Lekythos in the Shape of a Woman's Head in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2008","ElissaSCA","Terracotta Lekythos (oil flask);Greek, South Italian, Apulian, ca. 400-375 BC;;Accession # 21.88.65;;In the absence of plentiful sculptural-quality stone, artists of Southern Italy used clay to great artistic effect.

Schoenborn, 1995 (1996.403.6);;In 1909, over a ten-month period, Picasso was inspired to create more than sixty Cubist paintings, sculptures, and drawings of women that bear a striking resemblance to his paramour at the time, Fernande Olivier. Although few of these works could be considered traditional &quot;portraits,&quot; they do form a unique group within his oeuvre that shows him working with unusually singular focus. This bronze head of Fernande was modeled in autumn 1909 in Paris after the couple returned from a summer trip to Spain (Horta de Ebro), and represents Picasso's first Cubist sculpture. Like his early Cubist paintings, the shape of her sculpted head is faceted into smaller units. Fernande's hair, which she wore up in a rolled do, is here a series of crescent blobs, while her contemplative face is more sharply chiseled into flat planes. Intended to be seen in the round, the composition changes form when viewed from different angles, and the head's slight tilt and the neck's sweeping curves give the allusion of movement as if she were about to look over her shoulder.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pica/ho_1996.403.6.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pica/ho_1996.403.6.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: picasso,ElissaSCA: spanish,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 33","2891245745.jpg","-","Puerta del templo de Dendur","guillenperez","Puerta interior del templo de Dendur, regalo de Egipto a EEUU que esta conservado en el museo Metropolitano de Nueva York.;;Inside door of the Dendur temple, present of Egypt to USA that is preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of New York.","guillenperez: estados,guillenperez: unidos,guillenperez: america,guillenperez: united,guillenperez: states,guillenperez: usa,guillenperez: eeuu,guillenperez: templo,guillenperez: temple,guillenperez: dendur,guillenperez: puerta,guillenperez: door,guillenperez: entrance,guillenperez: entrada,guillenperez: egyptian,guillenperez: art,guillenperez: arte,guillenperez: egipcio,guillenperez: metropolitan,guillenperez: museum,guillenperez: met,guillenperez: nueva,guillenperez: new,guillenperez: york,guillenperez: manhattan,guillenperez: central,guillenperez: park,guillenperez: hdr,guillenperez: escritura,guillenperez: writing,guillenperez: geoetiqueta,guillenperez: geotagged,guillenperez: metropolitanmuseum,Description,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 33","2966152858.jpg","1990.38.2","Development of a Bottle in Space by Umberto Boccioni in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Umberto Boccioni.

(185.1 x 81.3 x 45.1 cm);;Bequest of Scofield Thayer, 1982 (1984.433.34);;Working in Paris during the early twentieth century, Gaston Lachaise found his lifelong muse in the ample figure of Isabel Dutaud Nagle, an American woman ten years his senior who was then married. When she left France for America in 1905, the young sculptor followed, never returning home. In America, Lachaise's talents as a sculptor blossomed in the company of Isabel, whom he married in 1917.; ;It is remarkable that during the first fifteen years of Lachaise's mature career (190621), when he was developing an individual style, he was also employed as full-time assistant to two noted academic sculptors: Henry Hudson Kitson in Boston (190612) and Paul Manship in New York (191321). While working at these jobs to support himself, Lachaise nevertheless found time for his own sculptural projects, producing some of his most original work.;;Lachaise began the monumental &quot;Standing Woman,&quot; his first full-size figure, upon arriving in New York in 1912. Over the next several years he made numerous revisions before exhibiting it publicly, as a painted plaster, at Stephan Bourgeois Gallery, New York, in February 1918. It was on this occasion that Bourgeois gave the work the poetic title &quot;Elevation,&quot; a name that both Isabel and Lachaise disliked. Because of Lachaise's ever-precarious financial situation, the piece was not cast in bronze until 1927, in anticipation of his forthcoming exhibition at Brummer Gallery, New York, in FebruaryMarch 1928. Several castings, some executed posthumously, exist of this sculpture. The Museum's cast, copyrighted 1927, was specifically made for Scofield Thayer's collection, which includes five other sculptures and twenty-nine drawings by Lachaise.;;The anatomical features of &quot;Standing Woman&quot; are undoubtedly based on those of Isabel, who was also the inspiration for a series of small plaster and bronze statuettes of a few years earlier. Her fully rounded torso is easily identified by the high narrow waistline, the broad flat back and buttocks, and the wide full breasts. In marked constrast to these massive horizontal forms are the elegantly poised hands and the tapered legs and slender feet, raised on tiptoe, upon which the entire weight of the figure is gracefully, and amazingly, supported. Although inspired by Lachaise's beloved, the figure in &quot;Standing Woman&quot; goes beyond the particulars of any single individual to suggest the more archetypal image of the ideal woman.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern_art/standing_woman_elevation/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=210003694&amp;collID=21&amp;vw=0>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern...</a>;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bronze,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 33","2975646449.jpg","1999.363.22","Three Men Walking II by Giacometti in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Three Men Walking II, 1949;Alberto Giacometti (Swiss, 19011966);Bronze; 30 1/8 x 13 x 12 3/4 in.

From an early age, Alberto drew, painted, and modeled portrait heads, his brother Diego serving as his first sitter. Although, after 1946, he would devote himself equally to painting and sculpture, until then it was sculpture that took precedence.;;By 1947, the artist had adopted what was to become his characteristic style, creating extremely thin and attenuated figures of three main themes: the walking man; the standing, nude woman; and the bust, or heador all three, combined in various groupings. Without volume or mass, the figures appear weightless and remote, their eerie otherworldliness accentuated by the mat shades of gray and beige paint applied to their bronze patinas.;;Giacometti designed the placement of these three walking men with the precision of a choreographer. Their steps are equally wide, and they do not look at one another.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwcm/ho_1999.363.22.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/euwcm/ho_1999.363.22.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: giacometti,ElissaSCA: bronze,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 33","2992669790.jpg","2006.277a-fff","Narva by Jean Tinguely in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Jean Tinguely.

Seated on a throne, the king is accompanied by a smaller male figure personifying the local god of the Coptite nome, the fifth nome (province) of Upper Egypt. This deity offers the king an ankh (hieroglyph meaning &quot;life&quot;) with his left hand. The nome standard, with its double-falcon emblem, is carved above the god's head. Sahure wears the nemes headcloth and straight false beard of a living pharaoh. The flaring hood of the uraeus, the cobra goddess who protected Egyptian kings, is visible on his brow. The nome god wears the archaic wig and curling beard of a deity.;;The statue may have been intended to decorate the king's pyramid complex at Abusir, about fifteen miles south of Giza. At the end of the previous dynasty, multiple statues of this type were placed in the temple of Menkaure (Mycerinus) to symbolize the gathering of nome gods from Upper and Lower Egypt around the king. However, since no other statues of this type are preserved from Sahure's reign, it is possible that this statue was a royal dedication in one of the temples in Coptos (modern Qift).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/oking/ho_18.2.4.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/oking/ho_18.2.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: oldkingdom,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 33","3089249157.jpg","44.2.2","Elderly Man Flanked by Egyptian Gods in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2008","ElissaSCA","Elderly Man Flanked by Egyptian Gods;ca. 250 AD;Tempera on sycamore;Accession # 44.2.2;;This old man is painted in tempera on a fairly thick wooden panel.

Verus</i>;;This magnificent, almost perfectly preserved bust was found in the eighteenth century at the site of a villa that may have belonged to Lucius Verus at Acqua Traversa near Rome. It is a tour de force of Antonine marble carving with its deeply drilled curls and beard set against a smooth polished face.;;Lucius Ceionius Commodus Verus Armeniacus (130-169) was Roman co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius (161-180), from 161 until his death. Verus was the son of Avidia Plautia and Lucius Aelius Caesar, the adopted son, and intended successor, of Emperor Hadrian. When Hadrian's successor, Antoninus Pius died in 161, he was succeeded by Aurelius and Verus was opted as co-emperor. Officially both men shared equal powers, but in practice it was Marcus Aurelius who became the leader. Verus was given the control of the armies, proving the confidence between him and his senior brother.;;Between 162 and 166 Verus was in the East, commanding a campaign against the Parthian empire for the control over the Armenian kingdom. He lived the next two years in Rome, keeping a glamorous lifestyle before falling ill to, what was at the time believed to be food poisoning, but is now believed to be smallpox.;;Lent by the Musee du Louvre, Department des Antiquites grecques, etrusques et roamines (L.2007.26);;**;The April 20, 2007 unveiling of the 30,000 square foot Greek and Roman Galleries concluded a 15-year project and returned thousands of works from the Museums permanent collection to public view. Over 5,300 objects, created between about 900 B.C. and the early fourth century A.D., are displayed, tracing the parallel stories of the evolution of Greek art in the Hellenistic period and the arts of southern Italy and Etruria and culminating in the rich and varied world of the Roman Empire from from the Late Republican period and the Golden Age of Augustuss Principate to the conversion of Constantine the Great in A.D. 312. The centerpiece of the new installation is the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/522663013/>Leon Levy and Shelby White Court</a>, a monumental, peristyle cour court with a soaring two-story atrium that links the various galleries and themes. ;;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world. It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.;;In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.
