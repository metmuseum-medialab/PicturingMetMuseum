Of local manufacture, these brightly colored vases were made exclusively for funerary purposes. Around the top of this vessel is a row of small lion heads in relief, painted yellow against a purple background. Below the lion heads is a band of Erotes and triglyphs. The foot of the vase is decorated with a row of acanthus leaves modeled in high relief and painted red, blue, pink, and yellow.;;As is characteristic of this type of vase from Centuripe, the figural scene is confined to the front of the vessel. It illustrates a wedding scene set against a rich rose-pink background. The bride wears a long purple chiton with a yellow himation drawn up over her head to serve as a veil. She is handed a folded purple cloth by the figure at right. At left are two attendants, one of whom wears an ivy wreath and plays a tympanon.;;This vase, like others in its class, was decorated in tempera after it was fired in the kiln so that a full range of colors could be achieved.

Its shape, its dark red-orange color, and its decoration, a radial, rotational design limited to two abstract motifs set against a hatched background, all point to a date in the first century A.D.

(2 cm);Gift of Joseph H. Durkee, 1899 (99.35.218) ;;The Severan dynasty commenced with the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193211 A.D.), a soldier from Leptis Magna in North Africa (modern Libya). With his marriage to Julia Domna (25.78.90), by whom he fathered two sons, Caracalla and Geta, Septimius allied himself to a powerful and ambitious Syrian family. Some sources say that Julia Domna was the daughter of the high priest of the Syrian god Elagabalus, and that the future Roman emperor may have met her while stationed at a legionary camp near Antioch.;;Julia Domna was an educated woman and, together with her relatives, came to dominate the imperial court, giving the Severan dynasty a very oriental character with their predilection for luxuriant materials and other exotica. She also held considerable power during the reigns of her husband and her elder son, Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a), and is often shown on coins together with her husband or two children along with legends and images that emphasize her role as imperial mother and protector.;;The reverse image on this coin depicts Venus Genetrix, a matronly goddess with Eastern connotations of fertility and mother goddesses, sitting on a throne with a winged cupid at her feet. Venus was one of a host of goddesses represented on Roman coinage to enhance the attributes of the issuer of the coin or the person whose portrait graced the obverse. Other such deities include Juno, queen of the gods and the patron goddess of mothers, Fortuna, Concordia, as well as personifications such as Happiness and Fecundity. All of these were meant to be closely associated with the empress and her roles as the producer of royal heirs and as a model for women of the empire.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/99.35.218 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/99.35.218</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: coin,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: gold,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: empress,ElissaSCA: juliadomna,ElissaSCA: severan,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 18","5669937543.jpg","08.170.123","Orichalcum as of Antoninus Pius  in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Orichalchum as of Antoninus Pius;;Medium; Technique: Bronze;;Culture: Roman;;Period: Mid-Imperial, Antonine;;Date: A.D. 143144;;Classification: Coins;;Credit Line: Rogers Fund, 1908;;Accession Number: 08.170.123;;;Description:;;ANTONINVS AVG PIVS P P TR P COS III, head of emperor/IMPERATOR II S C, sow under oak tree suckling youngthe scene illustrates the Roman myth about how Aeneas identified the site for his new city in Italy, Rome;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_and_roman_art/orichalchum_as_of_antoninus_pius//objectview.aspx?OID=130008518&amp;collID=13&amp;dd1=13 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_...</a>;;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: coin,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: antonine,3D,Art2or3,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 18","5669937545.jpg","08.170.119","Orichalcum Dupondius of Nerva  in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Orichalcum dupondius of Nerva;;Medium; Technique: Bronze;;Culture: Roman;;Period: Early Imperial;;Date: A.D. 97;;Classification: Coins;;Credit Line: Rogers Fund, 1908;;Accession Number: 08.170.119;;Description: ;;IMP.NERVA CAES.AVG.P.M.TR.P.COS III.P.P., radiate head of emperor/FORTVNA AVGVST S C, Fortune standing with rudder and corncupia;Rome;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_and_roman_art/orichalcum_dupondius_of_nerva//objectview.aspx?OID=130008515&amp;collID=13&amp;dd1=13 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: coin,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: nerva,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: inscription,ElissaSCA: latin,3D,Art2or3,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 18","5670457148.jpg","96.9.375","Etruscan Bronze Torch Holder in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Bronze torch-holder;;Medium; Technique: Bronze;;Culture: Etruscan;;Period: Classical;;Date: late 5th century B.C.;;Dimensions: Other: 10 13/16 in.

Ingots of this characteristic shape were made only in the Late Bronze Age and seem to be the usual form in which pure copper was transported as a raw material to the ports of the eastern Mediterranean. Copper was mixed with tin, usually in a nine-to-one ration, to make finished bronze objects such as the adjacent stand (74.51.5684). The ingot's irregular surface was produced as the pure copper cooled in the open mold in which the metal was cast. The sheer weight of the ingot, approximately sixty-three pounds, is testimony to the large scale of the copper industry at this time and the bulk quantities of copper that were being exchanged. The discovery off the coast of Anatolia at Ulu Burun of a Late Bronze Age shipwreck with a cargo of over ten tons of Cypriot copper ingots provides remarkable confirmation of the extensive international metals trade in which Cyprus clearly played an important role.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_and_roman_art/copper_ingot//objectview.aspx?OID=130008969&amp;collID=13&amp;dd1=13 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: copper,ElissaSCA: ingot,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: age,3D,Art2or3,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 18","5697029270.jpg","1995.403.4a, b","Pair of Celt-Iberian Armlets in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title: Pair of armlets;;Period: Iron Age;;Date: ca. 5th4th century B.C.;;Geography: Iberian Peninsula;;Medium: Gold;;Dimensions: 1 in.

(85.24 cm);Rogers Fund, 1943 (43.11.4); ;The Hellenistic period introduced the accurate characterization of age. Young children enjoyed great favor, whether in mythological form, as baby Herakles or Eros, or in genre scenes, playing with each other or with pets. This Eros, god of love, has been brought down to earth and disarmed, a conception considerably different from that of the powerful, often cruel, and capricious being so often addressed in Archaic poetry. One of the few bronze statues to have survived from antiquity, this figure of a plump baby in relaxed pose conveys a sense of the immediacy and naturalistic detail that the medium of bronze made possible. He is clearly based on firsthand observation. The support on which the god rests is a modern addition, but the work originally would have had a separate base, most likely of stone.;;This statue is the finest example of its kind. Judging from the large number of extant replicas, the type was popular in Hellenistic and, especially, Roman times. In the Roman period, statues of Sleeping Eros decorated villa gardens and fountains. Their function in the Hellenistic period, however, is less clear. They may have been used as dedications within a sanctuary of Aphrodite or possibly erected in a public park or private, even royal, garden.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eusb/hod_43.11.4.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eusb/hod_43.11.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: sleeping,ElissaSCA: eros,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: cupid,ElissaSCA: god,ElissaSCA: mythology,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 18","5246195391.jpg","-","evening","jaroslavd","&quot;evening&quot; - marble sculpture by frederick wellington ruckstull;met, new york","jaroslavd: metropolitanmuseumofart,jaroslavd: marble,jaroslavd: sculpture,jaroslavd: nude,jaroslavd: bum,jaroslavd: bottom,jaroslavd: frederickwellingtonruckstull,jaroslavd: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 18","5421328337.jpg","-","mexican girl dying","jaroslavd","by thomas crawford;1846;metropolitan museum of art, ny;;another one from the archives","jaroslavd: mexican,jaroslavd: girl,jaroslavd: dying,jaroslavd: thomascrawford,jaroslavd: metropolitanmuseumofart,jaroslavd: newyork,jaroslavd: marble,jaroslavd: statue,jaroslavd: nude,jaroslavd: sensual,jaroslavd: metropolitanmuseum,3D,Art2or3,Description,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 18","5434801050.jpg","-","Entering the Met (Version 2)","Alex E.

Previously nomads in northern Arabia, the Nabataeans had already settled in southern Jordan by 312 B.C., when they attracted the interest of Antigonus I Monophthalmos, a former general of Alexander the Great, who unsuccessfully attempted to conquer their territory. By that time, the city of Petra (ancient Raqmu) was the center of the Nabataean kingdom, strategically situated at the crossroads of several caravan routes that linked the lands of China, India, and South Arabia with the Mediterranean world. The fame of the Nabataean kingdom spread as far as Han-dynasty China, where Petra was known as Li-kan. The city of Petra is as famous now as it was in antiquity for its remarkable rock-cut tombs and temples, which combine elements derived from the architecture of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Hellenized West.;;;;During the reign of King Aretas III (r. 8662 B.C.), the Nabataean kingdom extended its territory northward and briefly occupied Damascus. The expansion was halted by the arrival of Roman legions under Pompey in 64 B.C. At various times the kingdom included the lands of modern Jordan, Syria, northern Arabia, and the Sinai and Negev deserts. At its height under King Aretas IV (r. 9 B.C.40 A.D.), Petra was a cosmopolitan trading center with a population of at least 25,000. The kingdom remained independent until it was incorporated into the Roman province of Arabia under the emperor Trajan in 106 A.D.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/naba/hd_naba.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/naba/hd_naba.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: figurine,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: fragment,3D,Art2or3,AccessionInDesc,Description,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 18","5644754851.jpg","-","Limestone grave marker, 4th century B.C.

Given that the relief was sculpted in the fifth or sixth century, when classical traditions in the West had become formulaic, the naturalistic anatomy and complex treatment of the interacting devotees seem remarkable. But renewed Western influence would not have been necessary in this period of artistic renaissance, as classical motifs had been part of the Afghan heritage since Alexander the Great's campaign in the fourth century B.C.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2005.314 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2005.314</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 18","5653722185.jpg","1982.469","Torso of a Bodhisattva in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2010","ElissaSCA","Title/Object Name: Torso of a Bodhisattva;;Culture: Indonesia (Java);;Period: Central Javanese period;;Date: 9th century;;Medium: Andesite;;Dimensions: H. 12 in.

Many terracotta pigs, naturalistic and usually well sculpted, with slots cut at the top so that they could serve as coin boxes, have been recovered from around Trowulan, the Majapahit capital. Even though swine must have played an important role in the domestic economy, the reasons for the great popularity of this animal shape for coin boxes in Eastern Java are unclear. It has been suggested that the shape is a well-suited allusion to financial success as well as culinary delights, since pork and especially suckling pigs are considered a great delicacy. A few of these terracotta pigs are unslotted, and their function, like that of this rare example in bronze, remains unknown.;;The fierce look of this creature and his projecting tusks suggest he is a wild boar who is sufficiently domesticated to wear a chain with a bell, a common feature of most of the Eastern Javanese terracotta piggy banks.

Each side of the block is carved with an identical scene showing symmetrically disposed horsemen.

Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis fell to the armies of Alexander in 331 B.C., and his power extended as far as India. But in 323 B.C., while still a young man, Alexander became ill and died in Babylon. Deprived of his leadership, the empire that might have become the greatest of the ancient world was split by a struggle for power among his successors, the Seleucid kings.;;The Parthian dynasty, originally from the north and east of Iran, established supremacy in the Near East in the second century B.C., after the disintegration of Alexander's empire and collapse of his successors. Ctesiphon, the capital, was situated on the bank of the Tigris River opposite the earlier Greek settlement of Seleucia. The border between the western empire of Rome and the Parthian lands in the east ran between the central and northern Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Hatra in northern Iraq, southwest of modern Mosul, was a major trading city heavily fortified against Roman attack and populated by a mixture of peoples, Parthians as well as Arabs and the inhabitants of Syria.;;Once part of a decorated doorway in the north hall of the so-called Main Palace at Hatra, this lintel stone was originally positioned so that the carved surface faced the floor. The two fantastic creatures have feline bodies, long ears, wings, and crest feathersa combination of animal and bird elements typical of Near Eastern lion-griffins. Between the two figures is a vase containing a stylized lotus leaf and two tendrils. The naturalistic modeling of the creatures' bodies and the form of the central vase reflect Roman influence. However, the absolute symmetry of the composition, the pronounced simplification of the plant forms, and the lion-griffin motif are all characteristic of the Near East.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.145a,b rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.145a%2Cb</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: griffin,ElissaSCA: monster,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: parthian,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: mesopotamia,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 18","882306432.jpg","25.78.56","Roman Copy of the Diadoumenos by Polykleitos in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Statue of Diadoumenos (youth tying a fillet around his head), ca. 6996 A.D.; Flavian;Roman copy of a Greek bronze statue by Polykleitos, ca. 430 B.C.;Marble (Pentelic); H. 73 in. (185.42 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1925 (25.78.56);;This statue is known as a Diadoumenos, a youth tying a fillet around his head after a victory in an athletic contest. It is a first-century A.D. Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 430 B.C. The original bronze probably stood in a sanctuary such as that at Olympia or Delphi, where games were regularly held. Ancient literary accounts (Lucian, Philopseudes, 18; Pliny, N.H. xxxiv, 15) and over forty known copies attest to the original bronze being one of the most highly esteemed creations of Polykleitos, the renowned Greek sculptor from Argos who worked during the midfifth century B.C. Both in his sculpture and in a written text, the Canon, Polykleitos sought to represent the nude male figure with perfect harmony among all parts and according to principles that could be reproduced by others. He carefully designed his figures with special attention paid to bodily proportions and stance, so that the effect of the whole is singularly harmonious. The thorax and pelvis of the Diadoumenos tilt in opposite directions, setting up rhythmic contrasts in the torso that create an impression of organic vitality. The position of the feet poised between standing and walking give a sense of potential movement.
