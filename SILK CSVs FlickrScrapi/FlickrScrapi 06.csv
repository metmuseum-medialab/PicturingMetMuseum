Late in life, he recalled that as a young artist he made daily visits to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris during the summer months and produced studies inspired by these visits. In the 1880s, Gerome persisted in painting tigers in imaginary landscapes. The tiger is not indigenous to North Africa, but the rocky terrain of Tiger and Cubs is evocative of Egypt, where Gerome first traveled in 1856. The picture was probably painted about 1884, along with a nocturnal desert scene with a tiger that exhibited at that years Salon (La Nuit au desert; now lost).;;Bequest of Susan P.

Van Gogh remarked that she had a good eye and took the best. He began the portraits just before his breakdown in Arles, in December 1888, and completed them in early 1889. As he worked on the successive versions, the composition ( which he titled La Berceuse, meaning lullaby, or woman who rocks the cradle, indicated by the rope the sitter holds) took on added meaning. As he revealed in his letters, the maternal image became the locus of literary and symbolic associations, ranging from the writing of Dutch and French novelists to the consoling music of Berlioz and Wagner. Van Gogh envisioned La Berceuse as the center of a triptych, flanked by Sunflowers, like candelabra.;;The Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg Collection,;Gift of Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg, 1996,;Bequest of Walter H.

In this thirteenth century stained glass panel from Swabia in southern Germany, Jesse lies asleep at the bottom, and the tree rises, as in his dream, from his side. In branches coiling from the trunk, prophets hold scrolls that foretell the coming of Christ. King David holds a harp in the roundel immediately above Jesse, and the four upper roundels contain scenes from the life of Jesus, from bottom to top: the Presentation in the Temple, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Ascension.

In branches coiling from the trunk, prophets hold scrolls that foretell the coming of Christ. King David holds a harp in the roundel immediately above Jesse, and the four upper roundels contain scenes from the life of Jesus, from bottom to top: the Presentation in the Temple, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Ascension.

Rockefeller Gift, 1968 ;;Accession Number: 1978.412.206;;Description:;;During the eighth century the ancient Maya made numerous straight-sided ceramic vessels that were painted around the outside with elaborate, multifigured scenes. Many of the scenes were mythological in content, depicting events that took place in the underworld, the realm of the Lords of Death. Such a scene is illustrated here, in a monochrome painting or drawing in what is called the &quot;codex style,&quot; because of its similarity to that of the few Precolumbian Maya books, or codices, that exist today. Codex-style vessels are thought to have been made in the north-central part of Guatemala's Peten Department.;;The animated scene shows a lively, dancing figure holding a long-handled axe behind him in his right hand, and a raised handstone in his left. In front of him on a monster-head altar lies a deity figure known today as Baby Jaguar. On the other side of the altar appears, also dancing, a skeletal death figure with arms outstretched. While the scene has been interpreted as one of sacrifice, another interpretation holds that it is one of celebration.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50002944 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/5000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: mesoamerican,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: mythology,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 06","7177711353.jpg","96.9.36","Detail of a Terracotta Kylix Attributed to the Antiphon Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, April 2011","ElissaSCA","Terracotta kylix (drinking cup);;Attributed to the Antiphon Painter ;;Period: Archaic ;;Date: ca. 490 B.C. ;;Culture: Greek, Attic ;;Medium: Terracotta ;;Dimensions: H. 3 3/4 in.

By 325 he had succeeded in reunifying the empire, having defeated the last of his former tetrarchic colleagues, the eastern emperor Licinius. He thereafter aimed to establish a new dynasty and to found a new capital, named Constantinople after himself. Christianity played an important role not only in Constantines personal life and success, but also in the program of reform and renewal that he had planned for the Roman Empire.;Although the court and administration no longer resided at Rome, Constantine was careful not to neglect the old imperial city and adorned it with many new secular and Christian buildings. The most famous of these is the triumphal arch, the Arch of Constantine, which still stands near the Colosseum. Similarly, the fragments of a colossal statue that now adorn the courtyard of the Museo del Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome, probably once stood in imposing grandeur in the main hall of the Basilica of Maxentius, a building that was completed by Constantine. Both of these works contain re-used material from earlier monuments, a practice that was not only economical but probably was also intended to shed reflected glory of the emperor by associating his reign in a very direct and practical way with that of famous good emperors from the past. The long face, neatly arranged hairstyle, and the clean-shaven appearance of this portrait head are a deliberate attempt to evoke memories of earlier rulers such as Trajan, who in the later third and fourth centuries was seen as an ideal example of a Roman emperor. Certainly, by the time that the head was set up, as part of either a bust or, more probably, an over life-sized statue, Constantine had adopted an official image that was intended to set him apart from his immediate predecessors.;  addl Marble portrait head of the Emperor Constantine I Date: ca.

However, only the Gospel of Saint John refers to Nicodemus, a Pharisee, as being in attendance. None of the Gospels describes the crowd of mourners gathered at the bier, as seen here, but the depiction of such a group is typical in French art of the Gothic period.;;About 1400, the technique of enameling en ronde-bosse, which was used for this plaque, became a hallmark of goldsmiths' work for the French royal court. Jewel-like in its effect, it combines luminous color-as well as, here, the mottled gray of the sarcophagus and the floral patterning on the Virgin's gown-with finely detailed goldwork, as seen in the precisely detailed physiognomies and the scroll pattern stippled on the gold ground.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/170006014 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1700...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: enamel,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: christ,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: gothic,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: gold,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 06","6740771241.jpg","1976.422.5","Virgin Adoring the Christ Child in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2011","ElissaSCA","Virgin adoring the Christ Child;;After a composition by Lelio Orsi (called Lelio da Novellara) (15111587) ;;;Date: probably 17th century ;;Culture: Italian (Reggio Emilia) ;;Medium: Ivory ;;Dimensions: H. 3-1/4 in.

At her left is a diminutive kneeling figure, undoubtedly the donor. This miniature sculpture was reportedly found in the Seoni district of Madhya Pradesh, central India.

Given that the relief was sculpted in the fifth or sixth century, when classical traditions in the West had become formulaic, the naturalistic anatomy and complex treatment of the interacting devotees seem remarkable. But renewed Western influence would not have been necessary in this period of artistic renaissance, as classical motifs had been part of the Afghan heritage since Alexander the Great's campaign in the fourth century B.C.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2005.314 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2005.314</a>  addl Niche with the Seated Bodhisattva Shakyamuni Flanked by Devotees and an Elephant Date: ca. 4th–5th century Medium: Stucco Accession Number: 2005.314 On view in Gallery 236","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: buddha,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 06","7122258157.jpg","18.9.2","Detail of the Portrait of the Boy Eutyches in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2011","ElissaSCA","Portrait of the Boy Eutyches;;Period: Roman Period ;;Date: A.D. 100150 ;;Geography: Egypt ;;Medium: Encaustic on wood, paint ;;Dimensions: h. 38 cm (14 15/16 in); w. 19 cm (7 1/2 in) ;;Credit Line: Gift of Edward S. Harkness, 1918 ;;Accession Number: 18.9.2;;Description:;;The young teenage boy in this remarkably lifelike portrait looks calmly at the viewer, his head in three-quarter view. He is dressed in a white Roman tunic with a narrow purple clavus (a vertical stripe) over the right shoulder. A mantle is draped over the left shoulder. The boy wears his dark brown hair short, with locks brushed to both sides of the forehead. The inscription in dark purple pigment below the neckline of the tunic is in Greek, which was the common language of the eastern Mediterranean at the time. Scholars do not completely agree on the inscription's translation. The boy's name (&quot;Eutyches, freedman of Kasanios&quot;) seems indisputable; then follows either &quot;son of Herakleides Evandros&quot; or &quot;Herakleides, son of Evandros.&quot; It is also unclear whether the &quot;I signed&quot; at the end of the inscription refers to the painter of the portrait or to the manumission (act of freeing a slave) that would have been witnessed by Herakleides or Evandros. An artist's signature would be unique in mummy portraits.;;Paintings of this type, often called Faiyum portraits (though not all of them come from the Faiyum oasis), are typical products of the multicultural, multiethnic society of Roman Egypt. Most of them are painted in the elaborate encaustic technique, in which pigments were mixed with hot or cold beeswax and other ingredients, such as egg, resin, and linseed oil. This versatile medium allowed artists to create images that in many ways are akin to oil paintings. The boy's head, for instance, stands out from the light olive-colored background, creating an impression of real depth. His face is modeled with flowing brushstrokes and a subtle blend of light and dark colors. Shadows on the left side of the face, neck, and garment and bright shiny spots on the forehead and below the right eye indicate a strong source of light on the boy's right. Most arresting are the dark brown eyes with black pupils reflecting the light with bright spots. This manner of painting, which is very different from the traditional Egyptian style but was well known in Graeco-Roman Egypt, originated in Classical Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.;;Although the painting techique on Faiyum portrait panels is Greek, their use is entirely Egyptian. When a person died, the portrait panel was placed over the face of the mummy with parts of the outermost wrapping holding it in place. This implies Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. After having been ruled for three hundred years by a Greek (Macedonian) dynasty and a century or more by Roman administrators, Roman Egypt was an extremely diverse civilization. The population consisted of Roman citizens and citizens of Greek cities such as Alexandria (both of these groups made up of peoples of many different ethnicities) and native Egyptians. The subjects of the mummy portraits clearly were dressed and coiffed like Romans, and many of them bore Greek names or names that were Greek versions of Egyptian names. However, they and their families found consolation in the ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/100004780 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,Artwork,painting","Painting""SET 06","7137548987.jpg","27.66","The arched nude","dorochina","&quot;the vine&quot; by harriet whitney frishmuth at the Met  addl The Vine Harriet Whitney Frishmuth (American, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 1880–1980 Waterbury, Connecticut) Date: 1921; revised 1923: this cast 1924 Medium: Bronze Accession Number: 27.66 On view in Gallery 700","dorochina: met,dorochina: metropolitan,dorochina: museum,dorochina: art,dorochina: nyc,dorochina: ny,dorochina: new,dorochina: york,dorochina: woman,dorochina: nude,dorochina: female,dorochina: body,dorochina: sculpture,dorochina: model,dorochina: curve,dorochina: stone,dorochina: bronze,dorochina: beauty,dorochina: arched,dorochina: arch,dorochina: naked,dorochina: open,dorochina: touch,dorochina: thevine,dorochina: harriet,dorochina: whitney,dorochina: frishmuth,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 06","7143694955.jpg","15.48","Twilight_TheMET(1)","rverc","Olin Levi Warner;Detail from: <b><i> Twilight </i></b> 1877-78 ; this carving, 1879;Marble;;Twilight was an unsual theme because it was not derived from Greek mythology, the source generally favored by sculptors for personifications.

(95.2 cm);Bequest of Mary Clark Thompson, 1923 (26.229);;Constantine was the first Christian emperor of Rome, and his reign had a profound effect on the subsequent development of the Roman, and later Byzantine, world. Constantine's reign marked a distinct shift away from the administrative system set up by the emperor Diocletian in 293 A.D., which saw the division of the empire into four territories each governed by one of four imperial partners. This Tetrarchy was founded on the idea of homogeneous authority; all four emperors were depicted together in portraits emphasizing their unity and indivisibility in order to bolster their strength and present the image of a unified empire. Although Diocletian's intent had been to permanently do away with dynastic succession, Constantine's aim was to establish a new dynasty and to found a new capital, named Constantinople after himself. He also succeeded in reunifying the empire with the defeat of the last of his former tetrarchic colleagues, the Eastern emperor Licinius.;;Although the court and administration no longer resided at Rome, Constantine was careful not to neglect the old imperial city and adorned it with many new secular and Christian buildings. The most famous of these is the triumphal arch, the Arch of Constantine, which still stands near the Colosseum. This work contains reused material from earlier monuments, a practice that was not only economical but probably also intended to shed reflected glory on the emperor by associating his reign in a very direct and practical way with that of famous &quot;good&quot; emperors from the past. This desire to link himself to his revered predecessors greatly influenced Constantine's official portraiture, and contributed to the revival of certain classicizing features that had been absent from imperial portraiture for over a century.;;The full breadth of Constantine's portraiture demonstrates a remarkable evolution: early coin portraits show him in the manner of the Tetrarchs with a stubble beard and blocky physique, while later portraits such as this one, made after his assumption of sole power, show a significant change. In an effort to disassociate himself from his immediate predecessors, Constantine adopted an official image that recalled the calm, youthful faces of Augustus and Trajan. This colossal portrait head once surmounted an enormous statue of the seated emperor, and displays many features characteristic of Augustan and Trajanic portraiture. Most notably, Constantine is clean-shaven and his cap of hair is thick and arranged in comma-shaped locks across his forehead (compare this with the portrait head of Augustus (07.286.115). As part of his plan to reorganize the empire, Constantine's portraiture offered a new iconography to match his new regime.;;This monumental head, as in smaller portraits and coins of Constantine, presents the emperor as detached from the real world. It lacks the intimacy and individual expressiveness of earlier imperial portraits. Constantine gazes into the far distance with his eyes lifted as if to heaven. The symbolism is clear and sets the stage for the iconography of the early Christian and Byzantine world, where the emperor was seen as God's regent on earth.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/eust/hod_26.229.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/eust/hod_26.229.htm</a>  addl Marble portrait head of the Emperor Constantine I Date: ca.

These elongaged S-shaped channels were a popular form of relief decoration on vases and sarcophagi, especially in the second half of the 2nd century and the 3rd century AD. Two bearded snakes form the handle on either side of the vase. With their upper bodies coiled on the broad shoulder, they stretch their flat heads forward across the deep concavity of the neck to bite the projecting rim, setting up a play of spatial depth and light and dark effects. The motif of entwined serpents is appropriate for a funerary vase. Linked with the earth, snakes were associated chthonian powers, and the Greeks and Romans regarded them as guardians of sacred places, houses, and tombs. In the absence of a funerary inscription, however, it is not possible to determine whether this vase was originally intended as an ash urn or for purely decorative use.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.  addl Marble strigilated vase with snake handles Date: 2nd half of the 2nd century A.D.
