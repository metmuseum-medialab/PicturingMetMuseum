Although he was an accomplished painter of altarpieces and devotional works, Giampietrino seems to have carved a niche for himself with the depiction of female heroines of mythology and Roman history. Inspired by Leonardo's two Leda and the Swan compositions (both lost), the figures are generally shown nude and, often, full length and set in a landscape. Diana the Huntress, portraying the chaste goddess of the hunt before a dense bank of trees with a delicate deer beside her, is one of the most beautiful and poetic of these.

If the original inspiration came from Leonardo, Giampietrino relied on another source for the figure itself. She is based on a print of Diana by the engraver Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio (49.97.233), dated 1526, which is, in turn, part of the twenty-print series Gods in Niches, drawn by the Florentine Mannerist Rosso Fiorentino (14941540). It has been proposed that the Diana was one of a group of four images of &quot;female deities,&quot; including other panels depicting Minerva, Juno, and Venus and Cupid, all painted for the same commission. Although we do not know who owned the Diana originally, it is very suggestive that our first record of the painting is in a French collection.

By 1912, he had developed his own adaptation of Cubism. Utilizing pure color, he simplified the forms in his pictures into geometric components of the cone, cube, and sphere, leaving their contours unbroken. Leger was also fascinated by machines and modern technology. The Bargeman, which shows a boat set against a background dominated by the facades of houses, provided the artist with the opportunity to combine several of his favorite themes: motion, the city, and men at work. With colorful and overlapping disks, cylinders, cones, and diagonals, Leger presents a syncopated, abstract equivalent of the visual impressions of a man traveling along the Seine through Paris. All that can be seen of the bargeman, however, are his tube-like arms, in the upper part of the composition, which end in metallic-looking claws.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cube/ho_1999.363.35.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cube/ho_1999.363.35.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: leger,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 10","2915950350.jpg","49.128","Water by Charles Sheeler in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 2008","ElissaSCA","Water, 1945;Charles Sheeler (American, 18831965);Oil on canvas; 24 x 29 1/8 in.

Sheeler's experience as a photographer influenced his Precisionist style of painting, in which he emphasized the geometric shapes of objects in a hard-edged, clearly lit manner. For Sheeler, these monumental, streamlined forms signified human ingenuity in harnessing nature's power. His interpretation of American industry was somewhat idealized: workers are never shown, and the machinery is pristine and gleaming, free of any dirt or smoke. Sheeler expressed his feelings about the emotional symbolism of technology when he wrote: &quot;Every age manifests itself by some external evidence. In a period such as ours when only a comparatively few individuals seem to be given to religion, some form other than the Gothic cathedral must be found. Industry concerns the greatest numbersit may be true, as has been said, that our factories are our substitute for religious expression&quot; (quoted in Constance Rourke, Charles Sheeler: Artist in the American Tradition, 1938).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prec/ho_49.128.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prec/ho_49.128.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 10","3663560800.jpg","-","Woman, 1 (1950-1952)","Uncle Lynx","Artist: Willem de Kooning.

A sheet of studies for The Actor, made around New Year's Eve 1904, includes two profiles of Fernande and shows the same correction to the placement of the actor's left leg and foot that is visible in the painting.;;Picasso painted The Actor on the back of a previously used canvas, on which another, unidentified artist had painted a landscape with swirling water.

Rather than represent subjects with sophisticated realism, these young artists chose a naive style, stressing the decorative quality that could be obtained in a painted surface. It is well to remember that a picture before being a battle horse, a nude woman, or some anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order, explained Denis;<i> Springtime</i>, a double sided canvas, describes a purification scene set deep in the forest of Saint-Germain, near Paris.

(135.6 x 180.3 cm);Bequest of Florene M. Schoenborn, 1995 (1996.403.10);;Born in Greece to Italian parents, Giorgio de Chirico received his first drawing lessons at the Polytechnic Institute in Athens in 1900. In 1906, the family moved to Munich, where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, becoming acquainted with the magic realism of Swiss-German painter Arnold Bocklin and the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who encouraged the artist to &quot;refute reality.&quot; At various important junctures in his career, de Chirico lived in Paris (191115, 192532), as well as the United States (193638), but he spent most of his life in Italy. In Ferrara in 1917, he met the artist Carlo Carra, with whom he articulated a &quot;metaphysical&quot; style of painting in which an illogical reality seemed credible. Although the Metaphysical School was short-lived, its ramifications were felt in subsequent art movements, such as Dada and Surrealism.;;This composition presents one of the artist's famous deserted public squares. Somber monolithic arches on the right cast heavy geometric shadows, while on the left is a statue of the sleeping Ariadne. The statue, a Roman copy of a lost Hellenistic sculpture of Ariadne asleep on the island of Naxos after being abandoned by Theseus, had great symbolic meaning for de Chirico, perhaps because it evoked the classical past of his native Greece. In a series of five paintings, all from 1913, Ariadne is depicted from various angles, horizontally, vertically, and in partial close-up. Such early paintings, with their magical dreamlike qualities, were greatly admired by the Surrealists.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eust/ho_1996.403.10.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/eust/ho_1996.403.10.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: dechirico,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 10","6272225857.jpg","-","_MG_8798","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272227865.jpg","-","_MG_8799","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272228737.jpg","-","_MG_8807","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272229735.jpg","-","_MG_8808","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272230869.jpg","-","_MG_8810","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272232873.jpg","-","_MG_8811","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272233695.jpg","-","_MG_8814","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272240445.jpg","-","_MG_8836","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272241207.jpg","-","_MG_8839","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272242033.jpg","-","_MG_8844","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272243761.jpg","-","_MG_8846","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272245473.jpg","-","_MG_8862","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272247471.jpg","-","_MG_8864","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272250381.jpg","-","_MG_8875","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272251985.jpg","-","_MG_8888","lynn2356","NA","lynn2356: womanfriendimet,lynn2356: woman,lynn2356: metropolitanmuseum,lynn2356: lynnsavarese,lynn2356: lynnsavaresephotography,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","6272260671.jpg","2010.260","_MG_8926","lynn2356","NA  addl Marble Statue Group of the Three Graces Date: 2nd century A.D.

Grancsay, 1942 ;;Accession Number: 42.50.1;;;Description:;;This is one of a group of twenty-seven very similar Spangenhelme (literally, strap helmets), all of which date from the sixth century. These helmets are thought to have been made in or around Ravenna, the capital of the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy, as diplomatic gifts for foreign rulers, and have been found at sites ranging from Sweden and Germany to Yugoslavia and Libya. The Metropolitan Museum's helmet was discovered in the Saone River near Trevoux, France. It has also been suggested that these helmets were made in one of the court workshops of the Byzantine Empire.;;The helmets of this group are nearly identical in construction: four or six straps radiate from a central disk and connect to a brow band all of gilt bronze. The space between each strap is filled by an iron plate riveted in place. The decoration typically consists of patterns punched into the radiating straps and of birds amid an undulating grapevine embossed on the brow band. Crosses and other Christian symbols are occasionally included. Some of the helmets retain traces of silver foil on the iron plates between the straps. The richness of the decoration indicates that these helmets were intended for recipients of high rank.;;All the helmets originally had a pair of metal cheekpieces, a neck defense made of plate or mail, and a narrow plate extending down from the browpiece to protect the nose. Of these features, only the cheekpieces remain on a few examples.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/40002919 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/4000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: helmet,ElissaSCA: armor,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: iron,ElissaSCA: middleages,Art2or3,3D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,arms_armor,Artwork","Arms_Armor""SET 10","6196734725.jpg","56.171.44","Terracotta Pelike Attributed to the Altamura Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2011","ElissaSCA","Terracotta pelike (jar);;Attributed to the Altamura Painter ;;Period: Classical Date: ca. 470 B.C. ;;Culture: Greek, Attic ;;Medium: Terracotta ;;Dimensions: H. 16 3/4 in.

Its substance is conveyed by the alternation of sharp pleats and flat surfaces as well as by their contrast to both the tubular folds pushing through from below and the freely curling softness of the fringe. The woman's face is covered by the sheerest of veils, discernible at its edge below her hairline and at the cutouts for the eyes. Her extended right foot shows a laced slipper. This dancer has been convincingly identified as one of the professional entertainers, a combination of mime and dancer, for which the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria was famous in antiquity. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;viewMode=0&amp;item=1972.118>www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;vie...</a>.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: female,ElissaSCA: dancer,ElissaSCA: woman,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: ancient,Art2or3,3D,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 10","997234019.jpg","1993.11.1","Sarcophagus Lid with a Reclining Couple in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, July 2007","ElissaSCA","Marble sarcophagus lid with reclining couple;Roman, Severan period, ca. 220;;Accession # 1993.11.1;;The couple are shown as semidivine personifications of water and earth.
