Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale, Main Reception Hall;;left to right: Seated woman playing a kithara, enthroned couple (pictured here), woman holding a child;;These three large panels probably celebrate a dynastic marriage. At the left is a seated woman playing a kithara, a large stringed instrument; she must be an important personage at the court, for she wears a diadem and sits on a throne-like chair. The child who leans over her shoulder may also be a member of the ruling family. The wedded couple occupy the central panel. The ruler is shown in conventional heroic nudity, while his wife appears pensive, as brides in ancient art were often represented. The woman at the right is probably an oracle predicting the birth of a male heir, the future king. The image of a nude man wearing the white band that served as crown for Hellenistic rulers appears as a reflection in her shield.;;**;The April 20, 2007 unveiling of the 30,000 square foot Greek and Roman Galleries concluded a 15-year project and returned thousands of works from the Museums permanent collection to public view. Over 5,300 objects, created between about 900 B.C. and the early fourth century A.D., are displayed, tracing the parallel stories of the evolution of Greek art in the Hellenistic period and the arts of southern Italy and Etruria and culminating in the rich and varied world of the Roman Empire from from the Late Republican period and the Golden Age of Augustuss Principate to the conversion of Constantine the Great in A.D. 312. The centerpiece of the new installation is the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/522663013/>Leon Levy and Shelby White Court</a>, a monumental, peristyle cour court with a soaring two-story atrium that links the various galleries and themes. ;;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world. It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.;;In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.

(187.33 cm.) width 47 in. (119.38 cm.);;This fresco once decorated the west wall of bedroom 19, the Mythological Room, in the Imperial Villa at Boscotrecase. Third-Style Roman bedrooms were often adorned with mythological scenes that apparently imitated the framed paintings that hung in Roman houses. This example shows the Cyclops Polyphemus as the unsuccessful suitor of the lovely sea nymph Galatea, who rides a dolphin at the lower left. Polyphemus is seated in the center of a rocky outcrop, professing his desire for Galatea with a melody on his panpipe, but to no avail. As told by Ovid, Galatea hid with her lover Acis, the son of Pan, while she listened to the Cyclop's song, but he discovered them and rose in rage, crushing Acis under a boulder as he tried to escape. This wall painting comes from a bedroom in the imperial villa uncovered between 1902 and 1905 near the modern town of Boscotrecase, not far from Pompeii. The walls were predominately red and a large mythological painting filled the center on each side of the room. The painting seen here combines two separate incidents in the life of the monstrous, one-eyed giant, Polyphemus. In the foreground he sits on a rocky projection guarding his goats and gazing at Galatea, the beautiful sea-nymph with whom he is hopelessly in love. Behind and above to the right, he is seen again, hurling a boulder at the departing ship of Odysseus, who has escaped with his men from the giant's cave after blinding him. The landscape painting in the same room includes two consecutive incidents in the story of Perseus and Andromeda. At the front Perseus flies in to rescue the princess who is chained to a rock at the mercy of a seamonster; above to the right the happy couple are welcomed by her grateful parents. The fortunes of love and the ever-present sea are the themes linking these two works. The combination of disparate episodes in one panel was a bold innovation when these were painted. The translucent blue-green background tone unifies these magical landscapes and must have brought a sense of coolness to the room. ;;Rogers Fund, 1920 (20.192.17);;**;The April 20, 2007 unveiling of the 30,000 square foot Greek and Roman Galleries concluded a 15-year project and returned thousands of works from the Museums permanent collection to public view.

Both painters chose to represent the moment when Oepidus confronted the winged monster in a rocky pass outside the city of Thebes.

This Annunciation takes place in a comfortably appointed bedchamber, though many of the domestic furnishings have symbolic connotations. The carafe of water, through which light passes uncorrupted, and the vase of lilies are symbols of the Virgin's purity, while the empty candleholder signifies her imminent role as bearer of Christ, light of the world. Gabriel's priestly garb alludes to the ritual of the Mass and, therefore, the incarnation of Christ. A soft glowing light falls on the Virgin and suffuses the room, elevating the scene from the realm of the ordinary and signaling the sacred nature of the drama.;;;The Lehman &quot;Annunciation,&quot; one of Memling's most important works, reportedly retained its original frame, inscribed with the date 1482, well into the nineteenth century.

When the wings were closed, the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Annunciate were shown. When opened, on certain feast days, the Christ Carrying the Cross and the Resurrection would have been displayed, flanking a central image, perhaps the Lamentation. Characteristic of David's mature style are the deep, translucent colors and the sensitive integration of figures and space in the Passion scenes.

While of a similar palette, it lacks the potent, energetic surface of the Lehman canvas.","NA,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 20","4469731520.jpg","1975.1.194","Promenade among the Olive Trees by Matisse.

L'Estaque was no stranger to French artists, who for decades had traveled to the Mediterranean in search of sunlight and crystalline waters. Paul Cezanne painted there intermittently for three decades.;;&quot;House behind Trees&quot; is markedly Fauve in all aspects, taking its cue-sharp, bright colors, broad blue/black outlines, flattened space, use of white paint or untouched primed ground-from Vlaminck, Derain and Matisse, whose own startling Fauve canvases debuted at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1905. Braque's undulating dark outlines and dazzling patches of unmixed color give the canvas a staccato-like rhythm and decorative visual appeal. Braque's flirtation with Fauvism was short-lived, for by the fall of 1907 he was well on his way to the subdued palette and robust, volumetric constructions of Cubism.","NA,Art2or3,2D,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 20","4573342037.jpg","1975.1.233","Detail of Masqueraders by Raimundo de Madrazo y Garetta in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2010","ElissaSCA","Raimundo de Madrazo y Garetta. ;Spanish, 1841-1902;;Masqueraders;;Accession # 1975.1.233;;From the Robert Lehman Collection.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: spanish,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: costume,Art2or3,2D,AccessionInDesc,Description,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 20","4589198515.jpg","-","Antonio de Pereda (Spanish, Valladolid 1611 - 1678 Madrid).

In early November, wearing the regional costume of the legendary dark-haired beauties of Arles, she posed for both Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh was thrilled to &quot;have an Arlesienne at last&quot; and quickly &quot;slashed on in an hour&quot; his first, more summarily executed version of this portrait (Musee d'Orsay, Paris), using the thick jute canvas that Gauguin had brought with him to Arles. Later, Van Gogh enhanced that image by adorning the tabletop with two accessories befitting an Arlesienne: a parasol and gloves. Those finishing touches were probably added in December 1888 or January 1889, when he revisited the composition to use it as the prototype for the Museum's painting. Relying on more saturated and richly applied colors to add substance to the character of his sitter, and showing her seated at a table with books, Van Gogh made this more compelling portrait of his friendwhich he gave to her.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/ho_51.112.3.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/ho_51.112.3.htm</a>  addl Accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: dutch,ElissaSCA: vangogh,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: postimpressionism,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,Art2or3,2D,AccessionInDesc,Description,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 20","5243964030.jpg","-","Angel with Portative Organ Cristoforo Cortese (Venetian, active ca. 1390 - died before 1445) ca. 1401-1407.

They are identical in size, and the point of view differs by only a few yards. Sainte-Adresse, the well-to-do suburb of Le Havre, was the home of Monet's father. Destitute, Monet spent the summer of 1867 with his father and his aunt Sophie Lecadre at the cost of abandoning his companion, Camille Doncieux, and their newborn son, Jean. Monet attended his birth in Paris on August 8 and returned to Sainte-Adresse on August 12.;;The pair of paintings juxtaposes this sunny regatta, watched at high tide by well-dressed bourgeois, with an overcast scene at low tide, showing fishing boats hauled onto the beach peopled with sailors and workers. Since Monet never exhibited the paintings side by side, the contrast between them was not intended as a social manifesto but instead reflected differing conditions under which the same scene, convenient to his father's house, could be observed.;;Bequest of William Church Osborn, 1951;51.30.4;;From the placard: Metropolitan Museum of Art;;Detail: W 91 1867;  addl accession","rverc: europeanpaintings,rverc: metropolitanmuseum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,rverc: met,rverc: claudemonet,Art2or3,2D,Description,AccessionInDesc,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 20","5414914732.jpg","1993.132","Wheat Field with Cypresses_TheMET(16)","rverc","Vincent van Gogh Dutch, 1853-1890;;<b><i>Wheat Field with Cypresses</i></b>, 1889;Oil on canvas;;Writing to his brother, Theo, from the asylum in Saint-Remy in early July 1889,Van Gogh described his latest work in the series he had begun in June: I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of Scotch Plaid; the former painted with a thick impasto...and the wheat field in the sun which represents the extreme heat, very thick too.

His views of the water-lily pond are perhaps the most famous, but he also extracted novel compositions from other corners of the grounds. Like the paintings he made of water lilies, his views of irises were meant to rise from the particular to the universal. In this work, the most highly finished of the series, the flowers are offered not as botanical specimens but as archetypes.

(220.98 cm);Hewitt Fund, 1925 (25.116);;This young warrior, a little over lifesize, stands on a slanting base and leans slightly backward as if to gain momentum for throwing a spear. On the left arm, he once carried a shield of which only the central strap is preserved; it must have been of bronze, for the dowel hole is too small for the support of a heavy marble shield. In the raised right hand, he evidently held a spear, also of bronze, as indicated by the preserved portion of the hand and the glance of the eyes (the iris and pupil are incised). He is nude, except for a mantle that hangs over his left shoulder. On his head is a Corinthian helmet with the strips of the leather lining visible on the sides.;;This statue is a Roman copy of a Greek bronze original that would not have needed the curving tree trunk support that connects the plinth and left leg. Though this support must have been an addition made by the Roman copyist, it is noteworthy that the sword suspended from it is of a Greek type. The rendering of the hair as close-lying ringlets, the simplified planes of the body, the strongly marked eyelids, the quasi-parallel folds of drapery, and the complicated pose in momentary action, all point to a date around or a little before the mid-fifth century B.C. for the Greek original.;;The original statue, which must have been an outstanding work of its period, may have represented the Greek hero Protesilaos, who ignored an oracle's warning that the first Greek to step on Trojan soil would be the first to die in battle. The plinth of a second Roman copy in the British Museum, London, has a planklike form surrounded by waves, suggesting the statue might represent Protesilaos descending from his ship, ready to meet his fate. However, the Museum's statue was reinterpreted as a dying warrior falling backward, following the discovery of a wound carved in the right armpit. The Roman writer Pliny mentioned a so-called vulneratus deficiens (&quot;falling warrior&quot;) as being among the works of the Greek sculptor Kresilas. Other identifications have been suggested to explain the unusual stance and the unique iconography of this statue and of the copy in London, but none has been generally accepted.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/gwar/hod_25.116.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/gwar/hod_25.116.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: warrior,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: copy,ElissaSCA: classical,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 20","1490149469.jpg","48.76.2","Fragment of a Marble Tomb Relief with Christ Giving the Law in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2007","ElissaSCA","Fragment of a Marble Tomb Relief with Christ Giving the Law;Byzantine, from Rome, Italy;Carved late 300s, in Rome;;Accession # 48.76.2;;The image of Christ's Giving of the Law, called the Traditio Legis, recognizes Peter's role as the successor to Christ.

They may have been used as dedications within a sanctuary of Aphrodite or possibly erected in a public park or private, even royal, garden.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eusb/hod_43.11.4.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eusb/hod_43.11.4.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: eros,ElissaSCA: cupid,ElissaSCA: god,ElissaSCA: mythology,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: green,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 20","2231997532.jpg","13.227.3","NYC - Metropolitan Museum of Art - Marble portrait Lucius Verus","wallyg","<i>Marble portrait of the co-emperor Lucius Verus</i>;Roman, Antonine period, A.D. 161-169;;This fragmentary head comes from an over-life-sized portrait bust or statue of Lucius Verus, co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius (r.

Over 5,300 objects, created between about 900 B.C. and the early fourth century A.D., are displayed, tracing the parallel stories of the evolution of Greek art in the Hellenistic period and the arts of southern Italy and Etruria and culminating in the rich and varied world of the Roman Empire from from the Late Republican period and the Golden Age of Augustuss Principate to the conversion of Constantine the Great in A.D. 312. The centerpiece of the new installation is the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/522663013/>Leon Levy and Shelby White Court</a>, a monumental, peristyle cour court with a soaring two-story atrium that links the various galleries and themes. ;;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world. It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/>Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold. As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.;;In 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.;;The Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.

Pyu sculpture is extremely rare. Characteristic of the finest early Southeast Asian sculpture, the fluid modeling of this Buddha image emphasizes soft, flowing volumes rather than linear form. The large ovoid head topped by a wiglike coiffure with a tall, beehive-shaped ushnisha (cranial protuberance) is typical of Pyu bronze Buddhas, as are the full, sensual lips and the long, fleshy nose with a slight hook at the end, perhaps a vestige of Indian influence. (Ritual handling has partially effaced the modeling of the eyes.) The authoritative chest, with its exaggeratedly low pectoral muscles, forms a plane that sweeps down from the broad shoulders to the subtle transition to the soft belly below, where a deep indentation indicates the waist of the Buddha's garment. The thighs are naturalistically proportioned, but the lower legs and feet are somewhat stunted; emphasis is given instead to the large surviving hand, one of the distinguishing characteristics of a Buddha.;;This Buddha originally may have held both of his hands in vitarkamudra, the teaching gesture (the small metal tenon that supported his now broken hand can be seen on his right thigh).

Whatever the age of the owner at her death, she was given a youthful countenance for the eternal afterlife. The shape of the face, with its long slender nose, sloe eyes, and sensuous mouth, identifies it as a product of the latter half of the Amarna period. The jar and lid were altered in antiquity, making it extremely difficult to identify the original owner.;;The striking face carved on the jar lid represents one of the royal women of Amarna. Her hairstyle of overlapping curls, known as the Nubian wig, was worn only by adults and was popular among the female members of Akhenaten's family. The hole at the center of the forehead once secured the separately carved upper body of a rearing cobra whose tail is visible across the top of the wig. This royal protector was exclusively worn by kings and queens.;;Since its discovery in 1907, the face has been variously identified as that of Queen Tiye, Akhenaten's mother; Queen Nefertiti, his principal wife; Queen Kiya, his beloved secondary wife; and Princess Merytaten, his eldest daughter. For a time, it was even identified as Akhenaten himself. This confusion is understandable, since the inscription identifying the owner was almost completely erased. Faint traces of hieroglyphs indicate that the jar was originally inscribed for Kiya, and the Nubian wig is most frequently associated with this queen. In some respects, however, the face more closely resembles later representations of Tiye, and it is possible that the lid originally belonged to her burial equipment and was later placed on Kiya's canopic jar.;;The tomb in which the jar was found, KV 55 in the Valley of the Kings, is probably the most controversial of all Egyptian tombs. It contained burial equipment inscribed for Queen Tiye and magical bricks with the name of Akhenaten. There were also four canopic jars (including this one) and an inlaid wooden coffin almost certainly made for Kiya. It appears that, for safekeeping, Tutankhamun had this material transferred to Thebes from Akhenaten's tomb at Amarna, which seems to have been plundered soon after Akhenaten's death. The jars and coffin of Kiya may have been reused at that time for the burial of another member of the royal family.","BrassIvyDesign: metropolitanmuseumofart,BrassIvyDesign: metropolitanmuseum,BrassIvyDesign: archaeology,BrassIvyDesign: artifact,BrassIvyDesign: antiquity,BrassIvyDesign: egypt,BrassIvyDesign: amarna,BrassIvyDesign: tiye,BrassIvyDesign: akenaten,BrassIvyDesign: queen,BrassIvyDesign: nubian,BrassIvyDesign: canopic,BrassIvyDesign: jar,BrassIvyDesign: lid,BrassIvyDesign: white,BrassIvyDesign: tutankhamun,BrassIvyDesign: 18thdynasty,BrassIvyDesign: travertine,BrassIvyDesign: funerary,BrassIvyDesign: portrait,BrassIvyDesign: beauty,BrassIvyDesign: youth,BrassIvyDesign: egyptian,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 20","5444055858.jpg","-","Bronze statuette of Aphrodite","BrassIvyDesign","Greek, Late Hellenistic;late 2nd or 1st century B.C.;;The eyes are inlaid with glass paste. The proper left leg from the knee down is restored;;The Greeks did not represent the goddess Aphrodite as nude in large-scale statues until the middle of the fourth century B.C., when the sculptor Praxiteles created the famous Aphrodite of Knidos. Representations of the nude Aphrodite in a variety of types and media became widespread by the Late Hellenistic period. This statuette is a variant of the Aphrodite Anadyomene (hair-binding) type. The pose may have been inspired by a work that had a canonical status equivalent to the Aphrodite of Knidos, a famous painting of Aphrodite Anadyomene by Apelles, court painter of Alexander the Great. The variant exemplified here was clearly popular in this size and medium, since several examples are known.;;By referencing other copies of this type, one can conclude that the figure's left forearm was raised in a similar manner similar to the right one. She is probably shown in the act of arranging her hair and may even be grasping the ends of the fillet wound about her hair to tie it off. However, since the attribute she held in her hands is missing, various reconstructions are possible. It has also been suggested that the goddess is represented as adorning herself with jewelry.","BrassIvyDesign: artifact,BrassIvyDesign: archaeology,BrassIvyDesign: ancient,BrassIvyDesign: metropolitanmuseumofart,BrassIvyDesign: metropolitanmuseum,BrassIvyDesign: bronze,BrassIvyDesign: aphrodite,BrassIvyDesign: venus,BrassIvyDesign: goddess,BrassIvyDesign: hellenstic,BrassIvyDesign: greek,BrassIvyDesign: knidos,BrassIvyDesign: anadyomene,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 20","5445305625.jpg","-","122","mister-tim","NA","mister-tim: newyork,mister-tim: bigapple,mister-tim: newyorkcity,mister-tim: nyc,mister-tim: manhattan,mister-tim: newyorkstate,mister-tim: america,mister-tim: usa,mister-tim: unitedstates,mister-tim: unitedstatesofamerica,mister-tim: northamerica,mister-tim: americas,mister-tim: metropolitanmuseum,mister-tim: statue,mister-tim: metropolitanmuseumofart,mister-tim: nude,mister-tim: male,mister-tim: ancientgreek,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 20","5445907034.jpg","-","111","mister-tim","NA","mister-tim: newyork,mister-tim: bigapple,mister-tim: newyorkcity,mister-tim: nyc,mister-tim: manhattan,mister-tim: newyorkstate,mister-tim: america,mister-tim: usa,mister-tim: unitedstates,mister-tim: unitedstatesofamerica,mister-tim: northamerica,mister-tim: americas,mister-tim: metropolitanmuseum,mister-tim: metropolitanmuseumofart,mister-tim: statue,mister-tim: bird,mister-tim: birdwithhumanhead,mister-tim: claws,mister-tim: bronze,mister-tim: roman,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 20","5448224617.jpg","-","0150 -
