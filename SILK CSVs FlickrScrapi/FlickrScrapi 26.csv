Vastly admired on the Continent, where it was exhibited in Paris, Ghent, and Bordeaux, the painting was subsequently shown in England and the United States.

David shows him calmly discoursing on the immortality of the soul with his grief-stricken disciples. Painted in 1787, the picture, with its stoic theme, is perhaps David's most perfect Neoclassical statement. The printmaker and publisher John Boydell wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds that it was &quot;the greatest effort of art since the Sistine Chapel and the stanze of Raphael. . . . This work would have done honour to Athens at the time of Pericles.&quot; The subject is loosely based on Plato's Phaedo, but in painting it David consulted a variety of sources, including Diderot's treatise on dramatic poetry of 1758 and works by the poet Andre Chenier. The pose of the figure at the foot of the bed was reportedly inspired by a passage in a novel by the English writer Richardson.;;Source: Jacques-Louis David: The Death of Socrates (31.45) | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art;;<a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/31.45 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/31.45</a>;;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;;The Death of Socrates is a 1787 painting by the French painter Jacques-Louis David.;;It represents the scene of the death of Greek philosopher Socrates, condemned to die by drinking hemlock, for the expression of his ideas against those of Athens' and corrupting the minds of the youth. The painting also depicts both Plato and Crito, with the former sitting ruefully at the edge of the bed and the latter clutching the knee of Socrates. Socrates had the choice to go into exile (and hence give up his philosophic vocation) or be sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. Socrates chose death. In this painting, a red-robed disciple hands a confident Socrates the goblet of hemlock. Socrates' hand pointing to the heavens indicating his defiance of the gods and fearless attitude to his death.;;This painting is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as one of Jacques-Louis David's greatest pieces of art.;;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Socrates rel=nofollow>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Socrates</a>  addl accession","michael.allen: jacqueslouisdavid,michael.allen: neoclassicism,michael.allen: socrates,michael.allen: stoicism,michael.allen: philosophy,michael.allen: ancientgreece,michael.allen: athens,michael.allen: nyc,michael.allen: metropolitanmuseumofart,michael.allen: art,michael.allen: history,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Art2or3,painting,Artwork","Painting""SET 26","4862354706.jpg","1982.530","Detail of The Mountain by Balthus in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, May 2009","ElissaSCA","The Mountain, 193637;Balthus (French, 19082001);Oil on canvas ;98 x 144 in.

Punnett Endowment Fund, by exchange, and Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, 1982 (1982.530);;The Mountain is one of Balthus's most important early works. Completed in 1937, three years after the artist's first one-man exhibition, at age twenty-six, this majestic panorama is also his largest canvas and one of the few that depicts figures in a landscape. First exhibited in 1939 with the title Summer, it remains the only completed painting in a projected cycle of the four seasons.;;Executed in objective and exacting detail, the realistic figures and landscape seem at odds with the surrealistically contrived narrative. Seven figures are located on an imaginary plateau near the top of the Niederhorn, in the Bernese Oberland, a landscape familiar to Balthus since childhood.

Completed in 1937, three years after the artist's first one-man exhibition, at age twenty-six, this majestic panorama is also his largest canvas and one of the few that depicts figures in a landscape. First exhibited in 1939 with the title Summer, it remains the only completed painting in a projected cycle of the four seasons.;;Executed in objective and exacting detail, the realistic figures and landscape seem at odds with the surrealistically contrived narrative. Seven figures are located on an imaginary plateau near the top of the Niederhorn, in the Bernese Oberland, a landscape familiar to Balthus since childhood. Either intentionally or unintentionally, the figures seem unaware of one another. Their gaze is trancelike, and one young woman is asleep on the ground.

Over the decade, Pissarro developed his approach to landscape painting, adapting the looser touch, broken brush strokes and lighter palette of his younger Impressionist colleagues. He also enjoyed contact with Cezanne, who lived in nearby Auvers. With characteristic interest in the pulse of daily life, Pissarro routinely painted inhabited, as opposed to pure, landscapes, frequently depicting villages walking on paths through the French countryside.;Formerly known as A Cowherd on the Route du Chou, Pontoise, this view actually shows the rue de Pontoise in the adjacent hamlet of Valhermeil in Auvers. Between 1873 and 1882, Pissarro painted some twenty works in the area, including a half dozen in which the red-roofed house adds a contrasting color note to the hillsides lush greenery.;;Gift of Edna H.

Between 1615 and 1616 he was employed on the same project as Orazio's famous daughter, Artemisia Gentileschi, who arrived in Florence in 1613. This picture must date about this time.

(18.4 cm);Gift of J. Pierpont Morgan, 1917 (17.194.226);;Many craftsmen of mold-carved glass decoration active in the first century A.D. distinguished themselves by putting their names on the molds and identifying the source of the object's manufacture. The most famous and gifted of these craftsmen is Ennion, who came from the coastal city of Sidon in modern Lebanon, and whose workshop is thought to have been situated there. However, Ennion vessels have also been found in Greece, Spain, and Gaul, as well as at numerous sites in Italy, and so it is very likely that his molds, as well as finished glasses, were traded throughout the Mediterranean. The quality and popularity of Ennion's products and, more particularly, his molds probably explains why they are signed.;;Ennion's products are distinguished by the fine detail and precision of their relief decoration that imitates designs found especially on contemporary silver tableware. Scholars have therefore suggested that Ennion trained as a silversmith and adapted the skills of embossing and chasing metal to the making of glass molds. This jug is decorated with an acanthus pattern along the shoulder that is typical of Ennion's workshop, and a rectangular placard with the inscription E N N I O N E P O I E I , or &quot;Ennion Made Me.&quot;;;Other mold-blown vessels that bear similar Greek inscriptions identify their makers as Iason (29.100.82; 59.11.3), Neikais, Meges, and Aristeas, whose names typically appear with the Greek word E P O I E I or E P O I H S E N , &quot;Made me&quot; or &quot;Made it.&quot; While all of these craftsmen probably worked in the Syro-Palestinian region, where mold-blowing first developed, Aristeas signed himself as &quot;the Cypriot,&quot; indicating that not all of them were locals. The habit of adding names to vessels in this way soon disappeared, and from the mid-first century onward most mold-blown glass was produced anonymously, like free-blown vessels. The one major exception occurs in the production of certain types of storage bottle (17.194.219), which carry distinguishing stamps on their bases. These stamps, often with names in Latin, are seen as trademarks that guarantee the contents or signify the place of origin, and not as a form of advertisement for the glassmaker.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.194.226 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.194.226</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: glass,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 26","4619547289.jpg","81.10.224, 17.194.225","Glass Vessel Signed by Ennion in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2010","ElissaSCA","Three Glass Vessels Signed by Ennion;Roman, mold-blown, 1st half of the 1st century AD;;Accession Numbers: 81.10.224, 17.194.225, .226;;Mold-blowing developed in the early decades of the first century AD as an offshoot of free-blowing.

Moore, 1891 (91.1.1402);;This bowl was cast using batches of different colored glass to create four roughly equal sections in translucent purple, yellow, blue, and colorless glass. On the interior is a lathe-cut groove just below the rim. The principal decoration comprises four hanging garlands of millefiori glass (59.11.6) fused to the upper surface of each quadrant. Few vessels made of large sections or bands of differently colored glass are known from antiquity, and this example is the only one that combines the technique with fused-on decoration. The bowl thus represents a masterpiece of glassmaking from the period when cast glass was beginning to be supplanted by vessels made using the newly invented technique of glassblowing.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.1402 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.1402</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: bowl,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: glass,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 26","4836238460.jpg","20.259","Fragment of an Amphora in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 2009","ElissaSCA","Fragment of a Terracotta amphora (jar);Greek, Attic, black-figure, ca. 540-530 BC;Attributed possibly to the Painter of Vatican 365;Youth steadying horses;;Accession # 20.259;;The composition of which this is a part would have been a harnessing scene.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: blackfigure,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fragment,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: amphora,ElissaSCA: horse,ElissaSCA: orange,ElissaSCA: black,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Art2or3,decorative_object,Artwork","Decorative_Object""SET 26","4847625279.jpg","-","NYC -

A contemporaneous photograph shows her to have been an elegant lady, with limpid eyes, high-piled hair, and a prominent nose. One sees that by suppressing the nose, Rodin could have made her look like the fashionable portraits of the time. But Madame X was an aristocrat as well as a poet and intellectual, the daughter of a Romanian princess and granddaughter of a diplomat and man of letters who had translated Dante into classical Greek. Her husband was Count Mathieu de Noailles, scion of a French family who traced its noble lineage to the eleventh century. In the thrust of the nose, tilt of the head, and veiling of the eyes, Rodin has made of her portrait a symbol as well as a likeness. The countess evidently saw only the nose, for the checklist of the Museum's purchases from Rodin in 1910 records her refusal of the marble and Rodin's preferred title: Madame X; &quot;otherwise,&quot; he wrote, &quot;she is a very intelligent person.&quot;;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4266682402.jpg","15.75","Lmetart-203","qpkarl","Mourning Victory from the Melvin Memorial, 19068; this carving, 191215;Daniel Chester French (American, 18501931);Marble;120 1/2 x 57 1/4 x 28 3/4 in. (306.1 x 145.4 x 73 cm);Gift of James C. Melvin, 1915 (15.75);;As early as 1897, Daniel Chester French was at work on a commission from James C. Melvin, a Boston businessman, to design a war monument honoring his three brothers who had died in the Civil War. In 1908, the Melvin Memorial was erected in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, Massachusetts, and is considered by many to be French's greatest war monument, if not his finest ideal work. Four years later, Melvin offered to fund a marble replica for the Metropolitan Museum, which was subsequently carved by the Piccirilli Brothers and installed in the Museum in 1915. French merged innovative technique and symbolic content in Mourning Victory, as he called the figure of the angel. She emerges from a cavity of a rectangular marble shaft, flesh from stone, darkness into light. The partial nude strides forward with hair and drapery swirling around her. The tip of a wing is visible near her knee. In one outstretched hand she holds a branch of laurel, while in the other she lifts above her head an American flag, its stars decisively rendered. This charged physical movement maintains a carefully orchestrated emotional balance with the melancholy restraint of the angel's downcast eyes.;;The Museum's version relates more closely to French's original model, because in the final design for the Melvin Memorial the figure was reversed. Apparently, the approach to the outdoor monument brought Mourning Victory's upraised arm in front of her face, nearly hiding it from that vantage point.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.   addl accession On view in Gallery 700","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4266683688.jpg","26.120","Lmetart-207","qpkarl","Daniel Chester French (18501931);The Angel of Death and the Sculptor from the Milmore Memorial;carving date, 1921-26; modeling date, 1889-93;Marble;93 1/2 x 100 1/2 x 32 1/2 in.

The original bronze statue, cast in Paris in 1892, was erected the following year in Forest Hills Cemetery, in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. When the plaster model was shown at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, it received acclaim that assured French's status at the forefront of his profession. In 1917, the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Robert W. de Forest, asked French, who was also a Museum trustee, about acquiring a replica of the bronze. French contracted the Piccirilli Brothers, New York's leading firm of marble carvers, to carve the statue in marble. Completed in 1926, this marble version required certain changes to accommodate the structural needs of the medium.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4266696800.jpg","-","Lmetart-361p","qpkarl","An excellent street lamp.;;<a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/association/>Tenuous Link</a>: Lamp.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4270137342.jpg","-","Lbubmetart-184","qpkarl","A life in the arts isn't all champagne and roses.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.","qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: 3d,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4295730561.jpg","-","Leku guztixetan_(metropolitan art museum)_Ikesten_","Iamamaia (kalaka 67)","-All rights reserved;-;-Tutti i Diritti Riservati;- ;-Tots els Drets Reservats;-Kaikki oikeudet pidatetaan;-Eskubide guztiak erreserbatuta!!!","NA,3D,Art2or3,Inhabited,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4311390525.jpg","2000.8","Camel with Packboards and Baggage in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, August 2008","ElissaSCA","Camel with packboards and baggage, 6th7th century;Western China or Central Asia;Earthenware with pigment ;H. 11 in. (27.9 cm);Rogers Fund, 2000 (2000.8);;This pottery model of a Bactrian camel may be a rare example of a Chinese-style tomb figure produced in Central Asia. The camel carries packboards that are loaded on either side with raised decorations of three figures under an arch supported by fluted columns with acanthus leaves above the capitals. The central figure wears a halo and full beard but no headgear. He is naked except for a loincloth. His bent knees suggest that he is in a weakened or inebriate state and requires support on either side by two women; the woman at the left wears a short coat over a long skirt and carries a Persian-type ewer. At the lower edge of the bags are a rhyton and another ewer.;;The identity of the central figure is uncertain. He may represent Kubera, king of the Yakshas, who is portrayed in the Gandharan art of northwest India as nearly naked and potbellied in drinking scenes, in which he is waited on by women. Such scenes were to some degree inspired by Dionysiac imagery from the Mediterranean world. In this version, the rhyton and ewers imply drinking; however, the full beard and absence of headgear is atypical of Gandharan representations of Kubera, suggesting other interpretations. One remote prospect is that the three figures in the main scene were somehow inspired by representations of the Descent from the Cross, an important theme in early Christian iconography. Although rare, Nestorian beliefs were known in China by the seventh century, and it is not impossible that images derived from this religious system had been transported to the East as well.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/nc/ho_2000.8.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/nc/ho_2000.8.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: camel,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4535741746.jpg","1999.29","Shield Bearer with the Ducal Arms of Saxony in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, February 2010","ElissaSCA","Shield Bearer with the Ducal Arms of Saxony;Honestone, partially polychromed and gilt ;German (Augsburg), commissioned (most likely) 1518, delivered 1521;;Hans Daucher (act. 1485, died 1538), design and partial execution, and Workshop of Adolph Daucher (ca. 1465-1523/24?);;Accession Number: 1999.29;;The boy, originally an angel (as can be determined by holes in the shoulders where wings once were), was commissioned by Duke George the Bearded of Saxony (r. 1500-1539).

A.D. 260270;Dimensions;Overall: 34 x 85 x 36 1/4 in. (86.4 x 215.9 x 92.1 cm);;Description;This highly ornate and extremely well-preserved Roman marble sarcophagus came to the Metropolitan Museum from the collection of the dukes of Beaufort and was formerly displayed in their country seat, Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England. An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). The figures are unusual in that the Seasons are usually portrayed as women, but here they are shown as sturdy youths. Around these five central figures are placed other Bacchic figures and cultic objects, all carved at a smaller scale. On the rounded ends of the sarcophagus are two other groups of large figures, similarly intermingled with lesser ones. On the left end, Mother Earth is portrayed reclining on the ground; she is accompanied by a satyr and a youth carrying fruit. On the right end, a bearded male figure, probably to be identified with the personification of a river-god, reclines in front of two winged youths, perhaps representing two additional Seasons. ;;The sarcophagus is an exquisite example of Roman funerary art, displaying all the virtuosity of the workshop where it was carved. The marble comes from a quarry in the eastern Mediterranean and was probably shipped to Rome, where it was worked. Only a very wealthy and powerful person would have been able to commission and purchase such a sarcophagus, and it was probably made for a member of one of the old aristocratic families in Rome itself. The subjects - the triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons - are unlikely, however, to have had any special significance for the deceased, particularly as it is clear that the design was copied from a sculptor's pattern book. Another sarcophagus, now in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Kassel, Germany, has the same composition of Dionysos flanked by the four Seasons, although the treatment and carving of the figures is quite different. On the Badminton sarcophagus the figures are carved in high relief and so endow the crowded scene with multiple areas of light and shade, allowing the eye to wander effortlessly from one figure to another. One must also imagine that certain details were highlighted with color and even gilding, making the whole composition a visual tour de force.;;Very few Roman sarcophagi of this quality have survived. Although the Badminton sarcophagus lacks its lid, the fact that it was found in the early eighteenth century and soon thereafter installed in Badminton Hall means that it has been preserved almost intact and only a few of the minor extremities are now missing.  addl accession Marble sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons Date: ca.

Wuramon are created for a one-time use during emak cem (the bone house feast), a ceremony that celebrates the spirits of the recently dead and the initiation of young boys. After being secluded within a ritual house for several months, the boys emerge one by one and crawl across the wuramon on their bellies. As each crosses the vessel, he is transformed from a boy into a man. Once across, he is seized by a man who cuts designs into his body; these heal into permanent scarification patterns that mark him as an adult. Crewed by spirits, the wuramon has no bottom to its hull, as spirits do not require a complete hull for their journey. The spirit figures have a dual nature: their outer forms portray supernatural creatures, but each is named for a specific recently deceased ancestor, whose spirit it embodies. A turtle (mbu), a fertility symbol because of the numerous eggs it lays, appears near the center of this wuramon. Behind it is an okom, a dangerous Z-shaped water spirit. The other figures, gazing down through the bottomless hull, represent menacing water spirits (ambirak) or human-like spirits (etsjo).

The human body is equated metaphysically with a tree: the legs and feet are the roots, the torso the trunk, the arms and hands the branches, and the head the fruit. In some origin traditions, humanity was born from wood figures carved by a primordial being named Fumeripits. Fumeripits built the first mens ceremonial house, but he grew lonesome living alone, so he cut down trees and carved them into human figures for company. The lifeless figures did not relieve his loneliness, so he made a drum. As he drummed, the figures slowly came to life, becoming the first Asmat.;Almost all human images in Asmat art depict recent ancestors, whose names;they bear.

Holding the eight original human ancestors and everything they needed for life on earth, the ark was guided by Nommo, the primordial being who created order within the universe. When the ark settled on the ground, Nommo transformed himself into a horse and transported the eight ancestors across the earth to water, where the ark floated like a boat.;;In this example, the horse's head is fitted with a bridle, representing Nommo's transformation into equine form, while the eight original ancestors are portrayed in two groups of four on the sides of the vessel.

In his hands, the young were neither miniature adults nor simpering objects of affection. Instead, Gericault endowed them with remarkably self-confident grace.;;The subject of this portrait is the nephew of Gericault's close friend the painter Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy. Gericault crossed paths with the family in Siena in 1817, at the end of his Italian sojourn; the Dedreux children returned to Paris with their mother in fall 1819, which helps to establish a probable date for the likeness. This canvas is one of a small group of drawings and paintings by Gericault (in various private collections) that depict Alfred and his sister, Elisabeth, two years his junior. Alfred became a painter, and like Gericault, was enamored of horses and equestrian sports. Eugene Delacroix, who had studied with Gericault, later owned this painting.;;Source: Theodore Gericault: Alfred Dedreux (18101860) as a Child (41.17) | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art  addl accession","Maulleigh: alfred,Maulleigh: dedreux,Maulleigh: 1819,Maulleigh: theodore,Maulleigh: gericault,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4847694843.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET: An Englishman","christiNYCa","Title;An Englishman;Object Name;Bust;Sculptor;Pierre-Antoine Verschaffelt (1710-1793);Culture;Flemish;Date;1740;Medium;Carrara marble; gray marble (pedestal);Dimensions;H. 29-3/4 in.

Most of them are painted in the elaborate encaustic technique, in which pigments were mixed with hot or cold beeswax and other ingredients. This versatile medium allowed artists to create images that in many ways are akin to oil paintings. ;;Although the painting techique on Faiyum portrait panels is Greek, their use is entirely Egyptian. When a person died, the portrait panel was placed over the face of the mummy with parts of the outermost wrapping holding it in place. This implies Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. After having been ruled for three hundred years by a Greek (Macedonian) dynasty and a century or more by Roman administrators, Roman Egypt was an extremely diverse civilization. The population consisted of Roman citizens and citizens of Greek cities such as Alexandria (both of these groups made up of peoples of many different ethnicities) and native Egyptians. The subjects of the mummy portraits clearly were dressed and coiffed like Romans, and many of them bore Greek names or names that were Greek versions of Egyptian names. However, they and their families found consolation in the ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife.","Maulleigh: encaustic,Maulleigh: faiyum,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848223888.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848225072.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848226248.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848231306.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848232450.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848233578.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848236122.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848237460.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848238846.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848241462.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848250742.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848251916.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET: Bronze statue of Eros sleeping","christiNYCa","Title;Bronze statue of Eros sleeping;Medium; Technique;Bronze;Culture;Greek or Roman;Period;Hellenistic or Augustan period;Date;3rd century B.C.early 1st century A.D.;Dimensions;length 33 9/16 in.

Conceived to house specific mystical forces, they were collaborative creations ;of Kongo sculptors and ritual specialists. This example belongs ;to the most ambitious class of that tradition, attributed to the atelier of a master active along the coast of Congo and Angola at the end of the nineteenth century and identified with Mangaaka, the preeminent force of jurisprudence.;That power was represented as a presiding authority and enforcing lord or king. Its crowning element is the distinctive mpu headdress worn by chiefs or priests. The figure's posture and gesture, leaning forward with hands placed akimbo on the hips, is the aggressive attitude ;of one who challenges fearlessly. Traces of a missing beard-a sign of seniority-survive in the form of nails along the contours of the chin. There are also vestiges of an abdominal cavity for medicinal matter that originally attracted the figure's defining force. The various metals embedded in the figure's expansive torso attest to its central role as witness and enforcer of affairs critical to its community. They document vows sealed, treaties signed, and efforts to eradicate evil. Ultimately, this work inspired reflection on the consequences of transgressing established codes of social conduct.","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: kongopowerfigure,christiNYCa: nkisinkondi,christiNYCa: mangaaka,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848277564.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848279074.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848281660.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET","christiNYCa","NA","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848284416.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET: Samuel Bernard (1651-1739)","christiNYCa","Title;Samuel Bernard (1651-1739);Object Name;Bust;Sculptor;Guillaume Coustou (1677-1746);Culture;French;Date;ca. 1720;Medium;Marble;Dimensions;H.

De Wailly, court architect to Louis XVI, had built neighboring houses for Pajou and himself, and Pajou executed busts of the architect and his wife. After her husband's death, Madame de Wailly married M. de Fourcroy, a medical doctor and chemist. ;;The portrait of Madame de Wailly displays the sculptor's gifts to best advantage. The solidity that characterizes his work is enlivened by an equally characteristic linearity, resulting in a brilliant eighteenth-century version of a Roman matron's portrait. The sense of dignity does not suppress the spirit of humor and intelligence that radiates from Madame de Wailly's fully mature countenance. This maturity is echoed in Pajou's handling of her torso, emphasized by the clinging cloth that partly exposes her chest and ample shoulders. The sinuous, weighty curls that frame her face and cascade over her shoulders are insistently sculptural, lending harmony and equilibrium to the work.","christiNYCa: museummile,christiNYCa: newyorkcity,christiNYCa: museum,christiNYCa: artmuseum,christiNYCa: sculpture,christiNYCa: itstimewemet,christiNYCa: metropolitanmuseumofart,christiNYCa: met,christiNYCa: nyc,christiNYCa: manhattan,christiNYCa: madamedewailly,christiNYCa: gothamist,3D,Art2or3,sculpture,Artwork","Sculpture""SET 26","4848315922.jpg","-","NYC - It's Time We MET: Louis Nicolas Victor de Felix, Comte du Muy and Marshal of France (1711-1775)","christiNYCa","Title;Louis Nicolas Victor de Felix, Comte du Muy and Marshal of France (1711-1775);Object Name;Bust;Artist;Jean-Jacques Caffieri (1725-1792);Culture;French (Paris);Date;1776;Medium;Marble;Dimensions;H. 31-1/2 in.
