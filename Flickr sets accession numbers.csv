In this painting, he discarded the heightened naturalism and precision of these models in favor of dreamlike distortion. He used artistic shorthand to render the central figure-an archer-yet one can easily detect the arrows and avian targets.'  addl accession Dutch Interior (III) Joan Miró (Spanish, Barcelona 1893–1983 Palma de Mallorca) Date: 1928 Medium: Oil on canvas Accession Number: 1996.403.8 Not on view","Art,Joan Miró,Metropolitan Museum of Art,New York,USA,Joan Mir√≥,painting,Artwork,2D,MetropolitanInDesc,Description,Framing,detail,single,Artwork_number"

SET 01,13131676454.jpg,23.2.35,Column Capital of the God Bes,Andrew Moore,"Egyptian Art at The Metropolitan - 'This large head unmistakably depicts the god known as Bes, or, more accurately, what is known as a 'Bes-image,' since Bes's appearance was sometimes adopted for other gods, and there is no name preserved on the statue. From the Kushite Period onward, images of Bes appeared on architectural support elements such as abaci, column shafts, or, rarely, large two-sided pillars. These architectural images are especially associated with mammisis, or temples celebrating the birth of a child-god; it is thought that this is related to the long association of the deity with domestic concerns and fertility. Such Bes figures are typically frontal and carved in high relief, but the depth of this figure against an abacus or shaft surface, if that is actually its origin, would have been quite unusual.  Another possibility is that the head originally belonged to a freestanding statue. A 1-meter-tall statue of Bes was found in a chapel at the Serapeum in Saqqara along with sphinxes dated to the reign of Nectanebo II. If this head comes from such a statue, the identity of the god represented by the Bes-image might not be the domestic god Bes but a number of the other gods-especially, but not exclusively, gods associated with Horus-who adopted the deity's appearance.  This head is said to have come from the site of Bubastis in the Egyptian Delta. Work at this important but much-damaged site has produced mostly hard-stone elements, but some fragments of limestone from wall decorations have also been found there. The limestone from Bubastis is visually quite similar to the stone of this head, so it could be that the statue does indeed originate there. If so, a date to the reign of Nectanebo II, who built extensively at Bubastis and whose name is attested among its limestone remains, would be a reasonable suggestion. Moreover, although there is considerable continuity in the representation of the disquieting features associated with the Bes-image in the Late Period and into the Ptolemaic Period, the carving of the god's preserved ear-which, although leonine, is greater in height than in width-is similar to that of certain images dated to the Thirtieth Dynasty.'  addl Column Capital of the God Bes Date: 332–30 B.C.

His tomb was a great shaft over sixty feet deep sunk into the desert and solid limestone bedrock in the Late Period cemetery that covers most of the area east of the Djoser complex at Saqqara. In a huge plain chamber at the bottom of the shaft, a rectangular rock core was left standing and hollowed out to house this anthropoid sarcophagus.

SET 03,1053572910.jpg,5.3,-,ElissaSCA,"In a time when emperors were hard-pressed to maintain their position of power, some ruled for as little as a few months and in many ways were wholly dependent on the fickle attitudes of their armies. Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expressionall of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a).;;Reconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. ;;The overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor. In fact, the boots Gallus wears are of a type often shown in representations of boxers, and would have been more appropriate for the palaestra, or exercise yard, than the imperial court.;;Although his pose is one routinely adopted by Roman emperorsrecalling Greek heroic and athletic nude statuesthe disproportion, wrestling gear, brutish crew cut, and stubble beard no longer evoke the ideals of classical Greece as in the days of Augustus. The technique of negative carving, which had been designed in the early third century for stone portraits of Caracalla, is here successfully used in the decoration of metal. This abbreviated style befits Gallus, an emperor who both achieved and lost the throne at the hands of the soldiers he led.; ;Text (slightly abridged) from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm</a>;;For an article on the conservation of this work: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_2003/roman.asp rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_...</a>;;and;;Bronze statue of the emperor Trebonianus Gallus;Roman, 251-253 AD;Said to have been found near the church of Saint John the Lateran in Rome;;Accession # 05.30;;This monumental bronze statue is one of the very few nearly complete Roman bronze statues of the third century preserved today. It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different. Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived. Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos. In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism. Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or a short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand. ;;The statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth centur","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: trebonianusgallus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: portrait,3D,Artwork"

Most likely, the figure standing under a parasol in the first chariot represents the deceased. His horses, like the others, are richly caparisoned, but the wheels of his chariot have fewer spokes. Splendidly embellished horses and chariot poles are part of a long tradition on Cyprus, although scholars have suggested that the prototypes for the chariot procession on the Amathus sarcophagus may have been Graeco-Persian reliefs.;;One of the short sides of the sarcophagus originally was decorated with four figures of the Egyptian god Bes. The cult of Bes was especially popular at Amathus, primarily because of the Phoenician presence in the city. The other short side of the sarcophagus shows four standing figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte. Nude except for their ornate necklaces, the four figures of the goddess hold their breasts in a pose that is well attested in Cypriot terracotta sculpture from the sixth century B.C. The temple of Astarte, located on the acropolis of Amathus, was one of the most important sanctuaries on Cyprus. The depictions of Bes and Astarte on this particular sarcophagus suggest the importance of procreation to the deceased.;;Most of the architectural moldings and the decorative details on the sarcophagus, such as the carved palmettes and ivy leaves that fill the four panels, are of eastern Greek origin. Other floral motifs, such as the tree of life and a frieze of lotus flowers and buds, had a long tradition in Cypriot vase painting and other arts of the Archaic and later periods. The figural panels are framed by a variety of vegetal ornaments, while the gabled lid once featured a pair of sphinxes and a palmette at each end. The thorough integration of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Cypriot stylistic elements on the Amathus sarcophagus is characteristic of Cypriot art and culture during the fifth century B.C.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

Pairs of lamassieither human-headed winged bulls or lionsprotected and supported important doorways in Assyrian palaces. The horned headdress attests to their divinity, and the belt signifies their power. Assyrian sculptors gave these guardian figures five legs so that the animal stands firmly in place when viewed from the front, but appears to stride forward when seen from the side. The Standard Inscription of Ashurnasirpal II is incised in the area between the legs of the figure. ;;;;;Genesis 10:11;Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,;Genesis 10:12;And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.;;;;;(Sir Austen Henry Layard 1849, vol.

Still, however, it remained firmly in its place. A rope having been passed around it, six or seven men easily tilted it over. The thick, ill-made cable stretched with the strain, and almost buried itself in the earth round which it was coiled. The ropes held well. The mass descended gradually, the Chaldaeans propping it up with the beams. It was a moment of great anxiety. The drums and shrill pipes of the Kurdish musicians increased the din and confusion caused by the war-cry of the Arabs, who were half frantic with excitement. They had thrown off nearly all their garments; their long hair floated in the wind; and they indulged in the wildest postures and gesticulations as they clung to the ropes. The women had congregated on the sides of the trenches, and by their incessant screams, and by the ear-piercing tahlehl, added to the enthusiasm of the men.;The bull once in motion, it was no longer possible to obtain a bearing. The loudest cries could produce were lost in the crash of discordant sounds. Neither the hippopotamus-hide whips of the Cawasses, nor the bricks and clods of earth with which I endeavoured to draw attention from some of the most noisy of the group, were of any avail. Away went the bull, steady enough as long as supported by the props behind; but as it came nearer to the rollers. The beams could no longer he used. The cable and ropes stretched more and more. Dry from the climate, as they felt the strain, they creaked and threw out dust. Water was thrown over them, but in vain, for they all broke together when the sculpture was within four or five feet of the rollers. The bull was precipitated to the ground. Those who held the ropes' thus suddenly released, followed its example, and were rolling, one over the other, in the dust. A sudden silence succeeded to the clamour. I rushed into the trenches, prepared to find the bull in many pieces. It would be difficult to describe my satisfaction when I saw it lying precisely where I had wi","NA,3D,Artwork"

It is thought that billowing clouds of smoke, produced by the burning of copal incense, accompanied every major ceremony in the Maya realm. Depicted on the censer illustrated here is a seated figure, perhaps a ruler, surrounded by aspects of mythological creatures that are stacked about his head and symmetrically flank his sides. The central figure is in higher relief, sitting cross-legged with arms carefully positioned in front of his chest. The position of the hands, held inward and touching, is known from sculpted stone monuments, where it carries connotations of rulership. A human head or masklike element is depicted in the figure's lap. The figure may represent a generalized concept of revered ancestor.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50007223 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/5000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: mayan,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: pottery,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

In addition to its very high quality, this saddle is also exceptional for having all of its original parts, including the elaborate seat cover of embroidered silk and the fittings of the saddletree. Although this type of saddle is often identified as Tibetan, the form of the saddle plates, the style of workmanship, and the type of saddletree, along with the similarity to imperial Chinese saddles, indicate it is more likely to be Chinese, perhaps from the imperial workshops. That it was used in Tibet, however, is demonstrated by the Tibetan letter ka, which is branded on the underside of the saddletree as a form of inventory number. It must have belonged to a Tibetan nobleman of the highest rank, possibly received as a gift directly from the imperial court. The saddle plates are made from relatively thick iron, deeply chiseled and pierced, the motifs densely arranged so that the gaps in the scrollwork are narrow. The plates are finely crosshatched and damascened overall with a thick layer of gold foil. The beads of coral and ivory in the center of the pommel and cantle are popular Buddhist symbols called the Three Jewels, representing Buddha, Dharma (Buddhist teachings), and Sangha (the community of believers).;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/40004933 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/4000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: saddle,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

The sculpture has been identified tentatively as Queen Ahmes Nefertari, mother of Amenhotep I, and dated to the reign of Ahmose (ca. 1550-1525 B.C.) at the very beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty. However, the remarkable flatness of the face and wig is familiar from certain works created during the Seventeenth Dynasty (compare the seated statueof Siamun in gallery 11), and the intriguing interplay of fleshy musculature in the lower part of the face is even reminiscent of late Middle Kingdom images.

Two bearded snakes form the handle on either side of the vase. With their upper bodies coiled on the broad shoulder, they stretch their flat heads forward across the deep concavity of the neck to bite the projecting rim, setting up a play of spatial depth and light and dark effects. The motif of entwined serpents is appropriate for a funerary vase. Linked with the earth, snakes were associated chthonian powers, and the Greeks and Romans regarded them as guardians of sacred places, houses, and tombs.

Such a scene is illustrated here, in a monochrome painting or drawing in what is called the &quot;codex style,&quot; because of its similarity to that of the few Precolumbian Maya books, or codices, that exist today. Codex-style vessels are thought to have been made in the north-central part of Guatemala's Peten Department.;;The animated scene shows a lively, dancing figure holding a long-handled axe behind him in his right hand, and a raised handstone in his left. In front of him on a monster-head altar lies a deity figure known today as Baby Jaguar. On the other side of the altar appears, also dancing, a skeletal death figure with arms outstretched. While the scene has been interpreted as one of sacrifice, another interpretation holds that it is one of celebration.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50002944 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/5000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: mesoamerican,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: mythology,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

Harkness, 1918 ;;Accession Number: 18.9.2;;Description:;;The young teenage boy in this remarkably lifelike portrait looks calmly at the viewer, his head in three-quarter view. He is dressed in a white Roman tunic with a narrow purple clavus (a vertical stripe) over the right shoulder. A mantle is draped over the left shoulder. The boy wears his dark brown hair short, with locks brushed to both sides of the forehead. The inscription in dark purple pigment below the neckline of the tunic is in Greek, which was the common language of the eastern Mediterranean at the time. Scholars do not completely agree on the inscription's translation. The boy's name (&quot;Eutyches, freedman of Kasanios&quot;) seems indisputable; then follows either &quot;son of Herakleides Evandros&quot; or &quot;Herakleides, son of Evandros.&quot; It is also unclear whether the &quot;I signed&quot; at the end of the inscription refers to the painter of the portrait or to the manumission (act of freeing a slave) that would have been witnessed by Herakleides or Evandros. An artist's signature would be unique in mummy portraits.;;Paintings of this type, often called Faiyum portraits (though not all of them come from the Faiyum oasis), are typical products of the multicultural, multiethnic society of Roman Egypt. Most of them are painted in the elaborate encaustic technique, in which pigments were mixed with hot or cold beeswax and other ingredients, such as egg, resin, and linseed oil. This versatile medium allowed artists to create images that in many ways are akin to oil paintings. The boy's head, for instance, stands out from the light olive-colored background, creating an impression of real depth. His face is modeled with flowing brushstrokes and a subtle blend of light and dark colors. Shadows on the left side of the face, neck, and garment and bright shiny spots on the forehead and below the right eye indicate a strong source of light on the boy's right. Most arresting are the dark brown eyes with black pupils reflecting the light with bright spots. This manner of painting, which is very different from the traditional Egyptian style but was well known in Graeco-Roman Egypt, originated in Classical Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.;;Although the painting techique on Faiyum portrait panels is Greek, their use is entirely Egyptian. When a person died, the portrait panel was placed over the face of the mummy with parts of the outermost wrapping holding it in place. This implies Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. After having been ruled for three hundred years by a Greek (Macedonian) dynasty and a century or more by Roman administrators, Roman Egypt was an extremely diverse civilization. The population consisted of Roman citizens and citizens of Greek cities such as Alexandria (both of these groups made up of peoples of many different ethnicities) and native Egyptians. The subjects of the mummy portraits clearly were dressed and coiffed like Romans, and many of them bore Greek names or names that were Greek versions of Egyptian names. However, they and their families found consolation in the ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/100004780 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

Van Gogh remarked that she had a good eye and took the best. He began the portraits just before his breakdown in Arles, in December 1888, and completed them in early 1889. As he worked on the successive versions, the composition ( which he titled La Berceuse, meaning lullaby, or woman who rocks the cradle, indicated by the rope the sitter holds) took on added meaning. As he revealed in his letters, the maternal image became the locus of literary and symbolic associations, ranging from the writing of Dutch and French novelists to the consoling music of Berlioz and Wagner. Van Gogh envisioned La Berceuse as the center of a triptych, flanked by Sunflowers, like candelabra.;;The Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg Collection,;Gift of Walter H. and Leonore Annenberg, 1996,;Bequest of Walter H.

SET 07,1053487558.jpg,"40.11.1a, 05.30",-,ElissaSCA,"In a time when emperors were hard-pressed to maintain their position of power, some ruled for as little as a few months and in many ways were wholly dependent on the fickle attitudes of their armies. Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expressionall of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a).;;Reconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. ;;The overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor. In fact, the boots Gallus wears are of a type often shown in representations of boxers, and would have been more appropriate for the palaestra, or exercise yard, than the imperial court.;;Although his pose is one routinely adopted by Roman emperorsrecalling Greek heroic and athletic nude statuesthe disproportion, wrestling gear, brutish crew cut, and stubble beard no longer evoke the ideals of classical Greece as in the days of Augustus. The technique of negative carving, which had been designed in the early third century for stone portraits of Caracalla, is here successfully used in the decoration of metal. This abbreviated style befits Gallus, an emperor who both achieved and lost the throne at the hands of the soldiers he led.; ;Text (slightly abridged) from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm</a>;;For an article on the conservation of this work: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_2003/roman.asp rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_...</a>;;and;;Bronze statue of the emperor Trebonianus Gallus;Roman, 251-253 AD;Said to have been found near the church of Saint John the Lateran in Rome;;Accession # 05.30;;This monumental bronze statue is one of the very few nearly complete Roman bronze statues of the third century preserved today. It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different. Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived. Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos. In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism. Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or a short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand. ;;The statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth centur","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: trebonianusgallus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: portrait,3D,Artwork"

For his debut in the prestigious post, Durand relied on large scale and a vertical format to transmute an image of daily country life, complete with a shepherd leading a flock along a dusty path, into a heroic American pastoral. He signaled the presence of poetic content by drenching the view in mellow light. The title refers to the large, mossy tree inhabiting the foreground, which is also recorded in Durands on-site study for the painting.;;Bequest of Maria DeWitt Jesup, from the collection of her husband, Morris K.

(74.9 x 109.9 cm) ;;Classification: Paintings ;;Credit Line: Hugo Kastor Fund, 1962 ;;Accession Number: 62.95;;Description:;; Edward Hopper's early training from 1900 to 1906 at the New York School of Art with Robert Henri, leader of The Eight, and his work as an illustrator between 1899 and 1924, led him to paint realistic scenes of urban and rural America. In 1924 a successful gallery exhibition in New York enabled him to give up commercial work altogether and concentrate full time on painting. Hopper depicted his favored subjects cityscapes, landscapes, and room interiors solemnly, in carefully composed compositions that seem timeless and frozen but are animated by the effects of natural and man-made light. As fellow painter Charles Burchfield wrote for the catalogue of the Museum of Modern Art's 1933 Hopper retrospective: &quot;Hopper's viewpoint is essentially classic; he presents his subjects without sentiment, propaganda, or theatrics. He is the pure painter, interested in his material for its own sake, and in the exploitation of his idea of form, color, and space division.&quot;;;In &quot;The Lighthouse at Two Lights&quot; Hopper isolated the dramatic silhouette of the 120-foot-high lighthouse tower and adjoining Coast Guard station against the open expanse of blue sky. Set on a rocky promontory in Cape Elizabeth, Maine though no water is visible in the painting the architecture is bathed in bright sunlight offset by dark shadows. Since 1914 Hopper had regularly summered in Maine, and this picture is one of three oils and several watercolors that he did of this site during summer 1929. To Hopper, the lighthouse at Two Lights symbolized the solitary individual stoically facing the onslaught of change in an industrial society. The integrity and clarity of his work made Hopper a quiet force in American art for forty years and one of America's most popular artists.;;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/210009492 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/2100...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: architecture,ElissaSCA: hopper,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lighthouse,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Artwork"

For his debut in the prestigious post, Durand relied on large scale and a vertical format to transmute an image of daily country life, complete with a shepherd leading a flock along a dusty path, into a heroic American pastoral. He signaled the presence of poetic content by drenching the view in mellow light. The title refers to the large, mossy tree inhabiting the foreground, which is also recorded in Durands on-site study for the painting.;;Bequest of Maria DeWitt Jesup, from the collection of her husband, Morris K.

A friend commissioned a portrait of Mrs. Stokes from Sargent as a wedding gift; the artist selected a blue satin evening gown for her to wear and began the sittings. He soon decided, however to portray her instead in the less formal outfit in which she had walked to his studio on day. When the dog that Sargent wanted to include in the portrait was unavailable, Mr. Stokes had a sudden inspiration, he later recalled, and offered to assume the role of the Great Dane in the picture, thereby getting two portraits for the price of one.;Bequest of Edith Minturn Phelps Stokes (Mrs. I .

For over a century, representations on vases document that wine, women, and song were central ingredients. Even more worthy of emphasis, however, is the importance of the symposium as an institution that permitted citizens to gather, to transact business, andas Plato's dialogue makes clearto engage in serious discussion. An essential piece of equipment for the symposium was the vase in which the wine was diluted with water and from which it was served.;;In black-figure vase-painting before the last quarter of the sixth century B.C., the decoration of large, elaborate kraters tended to be mythological. (On red-figure vases, the symposium itself was often depicted.) This krater is of exceptional significance because it is one of the first on which wine, women, and song are presented, albeit in a mythological guise.;;The subject, which encompasses both sides of the vase, is the return of Hephaistos to Mount Olympos, the home of the gods. Hephaistos, the divine smith, was the son of Hera and Zeus. Because he was born lame, his mother cast him out of Olympos. In revenge, Hephaistos fashioned a throne that held Hera fast when she sat on it. only Hephaistos could release her. Therefore, he was given wine and escorted to Olympos by Dionysos, the god of wine, accompanied by his male and female followers, the satyrs and maenads.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/130013841 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/1300...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: lydos,ElissaSCA: blackfigure,ElissaSCA: krater,ElissaSCA: archaic,ElissaSCA: satyr,ElissaSCA: god,ElissaSCA: mythology,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

(20.7 x 14.9 x 5.1 cm);Purchase, The Jaharis Family Foundation Inc. Gift, 2001 (2001.730);;This elegantly illuminated psalter opens with a handsome headpiece to the Book of Psalms (fol. 5r) with a bust of Christ at its center and, below the headpiece, an elaborate incipit letter formed by two birds, which may refer to Jesus' dual nature as both God and man. The late twelfth-century manuscript represents the tradition of &quot;aristocratic&quot; psalters produced in the Byzantine sphere before the fall of Constantinople to the Latin Crusaders in 1204. The many inscriptions in the text also make it representative of the liturgical works that remained within the Byzantine sphere after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. John Lowden has identified a hymn on folio 81r as written in a late fourteenth-century hand typical of the scribe Ioasaph (active 13601405/6) of the Hodegon Monastery in Constantinople. The inscription describing the execution of the Christian Nicholas Pazartzis in the Hippodrome in 1554 (fol. 83r) suggests that the manuscript remained in Constantinople for at least a century after the city's fall. An inscription on folio 4r records that the psalter was given &quot;to the most pious metropolitan of Ephesus Lord ... Anthimos in the island of Samos&quot; in 1639. Another, on folio 82r, demonstrates that it was still on Samos in 1672: having been &quot;presented by the holy sakellarios [treasurer] of Samos, the protopappas Lord John, successor of Lord Alexios, to the monastery of Prophet Elijah, [it was] rebound well, under the supervision of the present abbot of the said monastery, Joseph the hieromonk ...&quot; As these inscriptions demonstrate, the careful preservation of such works was one of the means by which the artistic traditions of the Byzantine era were preserved and transferred to the Orthodox faithful after the loss of the empire's political power.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cnst/ho_2001.730.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cnst/ho_2001.730.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: manuscript,ElissaSCA: book,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Artwork,3D,Description,AccessionInDesc"

Paul Cezanne painted there intermittently for three decades.;;&quot;House behind Trees&quot; is markedly Fauve in all aspects, taking its cue-sharp, bright colors, broad blue/black outlines, flattened space, use of white paint or untouched primed ground-from Vlaminck, Derain and Matisse, whose own startling Fauve canvases debuted at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1905. Braque's undulating dark outlines and dazzling patches of unmixed color give the canvas a staccato-like rhythm and decorative visual appeal. Braque's flirtation with Fauvism was short-lived, for by the fall of 1907 he was well on his way to the subdued palette and robust, volumetric constructions of Cubism.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/the_robert_lehman_collection/house_behind_trees_georges_braque/objectview.aspx?OID=150000193&amp;collID=15&amp;dd1=15 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/the_ro...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: landscape,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: house,ElissaSCA: tree,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: braque,ElissaSCA: fauvism,Artwork,2D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc"

The two men contemplating the sinking moon have been identified as Friedrich himself, on the right, and his talented young colleague August Heinrich (1794-1822). The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.;;Although the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times. Both men wear Old German dress, which had been adopted in 1815 by radical students as an expression of opposition to the ultraconservative policies then being enforced in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The staunchly patriotic Friedrich deliberately ignored the 1819 royal decree forbidding this practice and depicted figures in traditional costume until his death.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/european_paintings/two_men_contemplating_the_moon_caspar_david_friedrich/objectview.aspx?OID=110003080&amp;collID=11&amp;dd1=11 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/europe...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: friedrich,ElissaSCA: german,ElissaSCA: romanticism,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: landscape,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: moon,ElissaSCA: tree,Artwork,2D,AccessionInDesc,Description"

Images of Mars and Bellona occasionally decorated the headquarters of civic guard companies, which were important social institutions in Amsterdam, Haarlem, and elsewhere.

One important symbolic aspect was based on the understanding of the temple as an image of the natural world as the Egyptians knew it. Lining the temple base are carvings of papyrus and lotus plants that seem to grow from water, symbolized by figures of the Nile god Hapy. The two columns on the porch rise toward the sky like tall bundles of papyrus stalks with lotus blossoms bound with them. Above the gate and temple entrance are images of the sun disk flanked by the outspread wings of Horus, the sky god. The sky is also represented by the vultures, wings outspread, that appear on the ceiling of the entrance porch.;;On the outer walls between earth and sky are carved scenes of the king making offerings to deities, who hold scepters and the symbol of life. The figures are carved in sunk relief. In the brilliant Egyptian sunlight, shadows cast along the figures' edges would have emphasized their outlines. Isis, Osiris, their son Horus, and the other deities are identified by their crowns and the inscriptions beside their figures. These scenes are repeated in two horizontal registers. The king is identified by his regalia and by his names, which appear close to his head in elongated oval shapes called cartouches; many of the cartouches simply read &quot;pharaoh.&quot; This king was actually Caesar Augustus of Rome, who, as ruler of Egypt, had himself depicted in the traditional regalia of the pharaoh. Augustus had many temples erected in Egyptian style, honoring Egyptian deities. This small temple, built about 15 B.C.E., honored the goddess Isis and, beside her, Pedesi and Pihor, deified sons of a local Nubian chieftain.;;In the first room of the temple, reliefs again show the &quot;pharaoh&quot; praying and offering to the gods, but the relief here is raised from the background so that the figures can be seen easily in the more indirect light. From this room one can look into the temple past the middle room used for offering ceremonies and into the sanctuary of the goddess Isis. The only carvings in these two rooms are around the door frame leading into the sanctuary and on the back wall of the sanctuary, where a relief depicts Pihor worshiping Isis, and below partly destroyed Pedesi worshiping Osiris.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/the_temple_of_dendur/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100004628 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: temple,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: augustus,ElissaSCA: emperor,ElissaSCA: portrait,Artwork,3D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc"

They were undoubtedly produced by one of the leading Roman workshops that supplied the imperial family as well as affluent, cultured, private individuals - the same clientele for whom the villas around Rome and Naples were built, decorated, and furnished. They are decorated in high relief with figures of cupids and partially gilt. The cupids, several of whom are shown dancing and playing instruments, may be associated with Dionysiac festivities and are thus eminently suitable on vessels meant for a drinking party. But the figures have little, if any, real symbolism here and were chosen simply because they formed an attractive group. Like many other pieces of ornate silverware, these cups were clearly intended as much for display as for use. ; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;item=1994.43.1,+.2&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=13&amp;ite...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: city,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: empire,ElissaSCA: silver,ElissaSCA: cup,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,Artwork,3D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc"

Although the attenuated figure and extraordinary play of hands recall the El Greco-inspired mannerism of the Blue Period, The Actor can be seen as the prologue to the series of works that culminates in the enormous canvas Family of Saltimbanques (1905, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).;The new subject matter, palette, and sensibility of this picture coincide with the arrival of Picasso's new lover, the model and sometime artist Fernande Olivier (1881-1966). A sheet of studies for The Actor, made around New Year's Eve 1904, includes two profiles of Fernande and shows the same correction to the placement of the actor's left leg and foot that is visible in the painting.;;Picasso painted The Actor on the back of a previously used canvas, on which another, unidentified artist had painted a landscape with swirling water. Recently, a Museum visitor accidentally fell into the picture, tearing the canvas at the lower right margin. It has since been repaired.;;Frank Burty Haviland, the wealthy Franco-American painter whose brother, Paul, backed Alfred Stieglitz's New York gallery, 291, was likely the first owner of this work.

Grancsay, 1942 ;;Accession Number: 42.50.1;;;Description:;;This is one of a group of twenty-seven very similar Spangenhelme (literally, strap helmets), all of which date from the sixth century. These helmets are thought to have been made in or around Ravenna, the capital of the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy, as diplomatic gifts for foreign rulers, and have been found at sites ranging from Sweden and Germany to Yugoslavia and Libya. The Metropolitan Museum's helmet was discovered in the Saone River near Trevoux, France. It has also been suggested that these helmets were made in one of the court workshops of the Byzantine Empire.;;The helmets of this group are nearly identical in construction: four or six straps radiate from a central disk and connect to a brow band all of gilt bronze. The space between each strap is filled by an iron plate riveted in place. The decoration typically consists of patterns punched into the radiating straps and of birds amid an undulating grapevine embossed on the brow band. Crosses and other Christian symbols are occasionally included. Some of the helmets retain traces of silver foil on the iron plates between the straps. The richness of the decoration indicates that these helmets were intended for recipients of high rank.;;All the helmets originally had a pair of metal cheekpieces, a neck defense made of plate or mail, and a narrow plate extending down from the browpiece to protect the nose. Of these features, only the cheekpieces remain on a few examples.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/40002919 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/4000...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: helmet,ElissaSCA: armor,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: iron,ElissaSCA: middleages,Artwork,3D,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc"

One suggestion for his identity is the strategos (general) Phokion, pupil of Plato and one of the foremost Athenian statesmen of the fourth century BC, but there is little evidence to support that theory. We do not know if the original statue was a contemporary portrait, like the famous fifth-century portrait of the Athenian statesman and general Perikles, or a posthumous work. It could even be a representation of a hero from the mythic past. He wears a Corinthian helmet pushed up and resting on the back of his head.

(57.2 x 76.2 cm);;Classification: Paintings;;Credit Line: Bequest of Benjamin Altman, 1913;;Accession Number: 14.40.651;;;Catalogue Entry:;;This panel is one of several finely painted cabinet pictures made by Rembrandt during the 1640s. The subject of Bathsheba is from the Bible (2 Samuel 11-12) and was common in northern European art from the early sixteenth century onward. Its popularity derived, in part, from the inclusion of a nude female. The theme also carried strong moral associations: King David (barely discernable in the distant palace) spies on and falls in love with the beautiful Bathsheba and arranges for her husband to be killed in battle. He is reprimanded by the prophet Nathan; the child he and Bathsheba had conceived dies, and David repents. Rembrandt painted another work of this subject, about 1632; it is now lost, though known through a copy in the Musee des Beaux Arts, Rennes. His great canvas in the Louvre of 1654 introduces a mood of portending tragedy quite distinct from this earlier treatment.;;The background of the picture is abraded and the head and torso of the servant are badly worn. However, the foreground and the figures of the old woman and Bathesheba are well preserved, and cleaning of the picture in 1995 revealed an autograph work. Some scholars, beginning with Gerson in 1968 [see Refs.], had considered it a product of the workshop with, perhaps, some retouching by Rembrandt. An etching by Jean Michel Moreau the Younger, dated 1763 (MMA 62.695.125; see Additional Views) clarifies the original effect of space and illustrates how much detail has been lost. A later print by Le Grand [see Ref. Basan 1781] largely agrees with the Moreau etching. However, an etching by John Burnet [see Ref.

(64.1 x 41.9 cm);;Classification: Paintings;;Credit Line: Marquand Collection, Gift of Henry G. Marquand, 1889;;Accession Number: 89.15.19;;;Catalogue Entry:;;This is one of the defining works of Italian portraiture: the earliest surviving double portrait, the first to place the female sitter in a notional interior, and the first to include a landscape background. Each of these novelties was to be taken up and developed by artists only later in the century. Lippi has left us a number of altarpieces that include donor portraits, and these allow us confidently to date this work to about 144044, contemporary with the Annunciation in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome. That altarpiece also provides close analogies for the landscape seen through a window. Although there is the possibility that the picture was commissioned to celebrate the birth of a child, the sumptuous clothes and many rings worn by the woman are appropriate for a bride, as is the motto lealta (loyalty) embroidered in gold threads and seed pearls on her ermine-lined sleeve. The male is no less expensively garbed in scarlet and wears a hat designating his high social rank. On the basis of the coat of arms displayed by the male sitter, Breck [see Ref. 1913] tentatively identified the couple as the Florentine Lorenzo di Ranieri Scolari (a relation of the celebrated general Pippo Spano) and Angiola di Bernardo Sapiti, who are usually said to have been married in 1436 [see Pompeo Litta, Familie celebri di italia, Milan, 181983, fasc. LXVII (1850), disp. 122, tav. I and IV]; however, according to Katalin Prajda [correspondence in departmental archive file], they were still unmarried in 1439. Although the dark pigment of the coat of arms is a deteriorated blue rather than the expected black, Prajda notes that the Scolari employed a number of variations. She is currently pursuing the possibility that the Scolari coat of arms here may have been intended to identify the female rather than the male sitter.;;In this innovative portrait, Lippi retains the conventional profile view of both sitters but includes their hands. As with most later portraits, he situates the female in a domestic interior, the box-like shape and steeply foreshortened ceiling of which are plainly adopted from depictions of the Madonna and Child (Donatello's so-called Pazzi Madonna in the Bodemuseum, Berlin, and Scheggia's Madonna and Child with Two Angels in the Museo Horne, Florence). By contrast, the male stands outside the room, gazing through a lateral window opening, while a second window offers a view onto a landscape that, it has been suggested, may record property belonging to the family.;;The degree to which Lippi has generalized the features of the sitters is as notable as the implausibility of the &quot;room&quot; that encases the woman. One need only compare their features with the portraits he includes in the roughly contemporary Coronation of the Virgin (Uffizi, Florence) to see the extent to which detailed physiognomic description has been suppressed. The difference in intent comes to the fore if Lippi's portrait is compared to Petrus Christus's 1446 portrait of Edward Grimston (collection of Lord Verulam, on loan to the National Gallery, London), in which the highly individualized sitter is placed in a far more plausible room, with careful attention to the light falling through the panes of a circular leaded-glass window. This comparison is important, since there has been a persistent attempt to link Lippi's innovations to his awareness of Netherlandish practice.;;Lippi's two figures occupy different planes in space, with the female figure dominant and the male in a subordinate positionas an observer. Examination with infrared reflectography demonstrates that the artist carefully rethought the placement of the woman's hands, one over the other, to achieve an effect of demure self-pos","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: italian,ElissaSCA: renaissance,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: lippi,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc,2D,Artwork"

In the most recent monograph on Ghirlandaio, Jean Cadogan [Ref. 2000] catalogued it with Domenico's autograph work but qualified her attribution by saying the portrait &quot;is probably by an unidentified helper in Ghirlandaio's workshop.&quot; She did, however, observe the &quot;pronounced left-handed hatching of the brushstrokes,&quot; with diagonal hatching from the top left to lower right, which recur in other Ghirlandaiesque works attributed to Domenico's younger brother David. In fact, David was the only left-handed painter working in Domenico's circle [Jill Dunkerton. &quot;Michelangelo as a Painter on Panel.&quot; In Making &amp; Meaning: The Young Michelangelo.

William Middendorf II Gifts, 1985;;Accession Number: 1985.209;;;Description:;;Two prevailing influences converged somewhere between the Baltic and the Black Sea to initiate the development of this kind of brooch. Examples of small silver bow fibulae with square or rectangular heads, which originated in the Crimea and date from the third century A.D., are thought to have provided the model for the square or rectangular head of the type. Northern elements are represented by the open-jawed heads of the monsters just below the bow, in addition to other animal motifs, and by the partitioned, lozenge-shaped foot plate, whose surface is decorated with &quot;kerbshnitt&quot; (chip carving) and its extremities with raised knobs (the one on the end of the foot is now missing). Dividing the foot is a strip of niello (a black substance containing silver, copper, lead, and sulphur) terminating in an animal's head, and above the foot is a pair of stylized animal heads with gaping jaws.;;The bow is plain and is divided into panels by bands of niello. It is the border of freestanding masks that sets the Museum's example apart from the majority of great square-headed brooches, and allies it to a small group identified as the Lutton Heath type. The Museum's brooch, like most of the approximately 150 known square-headed examples that were made in England throughout the sixth century, displays the Anglo-Saxon preference for lavish surface decoration. These brooches, traditionally of gilt bronze, were used to secure the garments of peasant farmers. They were worn with the head plate upward, unlike some of the related Continental bow fibulae.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/medieval_art/square_headed_bow_brooch//objectview.aspx?OID=170006035&amp;collID=17&amp;dd1=17 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/mediev...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2011,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: jewelry,ElissaSCA: brooch,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: copper,ElissaSCA: middleages,3D,Artwork,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc"

Around the curved table, from the left, are the artists eighty-three year-old grandmother, Madame Frederic Mertzdorff, his three-year-old nephew, Jean, and his thirty-three-year-old sister, Andree Terrasse, with her two-year-old son, Charles, in her lap.

Bastis Gifts and Marguerite and Frank A. Cosgrove Jr. Fund, 2002 (2002.66) ;;This monumental head gives an impression of sovereign calm and power, even though the veil that once covered the top and back of the head is now missing. Although the features are cast in a thoroughly classical style typical of the late 4th century BC, the face is stamped with enough individuality to identify it as a portrait. In all probability, it represents a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, that succession of Macedonian Greeks who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC until the annexation of Egypt by Rome and the suicide of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC. Most recently, this head has been identified as Arsinoe II, who ruled together with her brother Ptolemy II, from 278 until her death in 270 BC. Not only was the queen part of a dynastic ruler cult during her life, she was also transformed into an independent deity by her brother after her death. She was worshiped as an Egyptian goddess in association with Isis and also separately as a Greek goddess, with her own sanctuaries and festivals. This strongly idealized head, which resembles classical images of Hera and Demeter was probably associated with the latter cult. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/greek_roman/viewone.asp?item=5>www.metmuseum.org/special/greek_roman/viewone.asp?item=5</a> and the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: greek,ElissaSCA: woman,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: hellenistic,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,The Lady of Shalot: ptolemaic,3D,Artwork,Description,AccessionInDesc"

On some related pieces, these figures are winged and have often been identified as Etruscan lasas, nymph-like characters frequently depicted on engraved mirrors and pottery. The precise function of duck-askoi has been hotly debated. Many seem too large to have been used for expensive scented oils and instead may have contained lamp oil or olive oil. Because some earlier duck-askoi have been found with a special type of barrel-shaped vase, some scholars have suggested a connection with wine.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_and_roman_art/terracotta_duck_askos_flask_with_spout_and_handle_clusium_group//objectview.aspx?OID=130011230&amp;collID=13&amp;dd1=13 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: etruscan,ElissaSCA: terracotta,ElissaSCA: clay,ElissaSCA: vase,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: redfigure,ElissaSCA: askos,ElissaSCA: pottery,ElissaSCA: ceramic,ElissaSCA: classical,ElissaSCA: duck,ElissaSCA: animal,3D,Artwork,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc"

Ingots of this characteristic shape were made only in the Late Bronze Age and seem to be the usual form in which pure copper was transported as a raw material to the ports of the eastern Mediterranean. Copper was mixed with tin, usually in a nine-to-one ration, to make finished bronze objects such as the adjacent stand (74.51.5684). The ingot's irregular surface was produced as the pure copper cooled in the open mold in which the metal was cast. The sheer weight of the ingot, approximately sixty-three pounds, is testimony to the large scale of the copper industry at this time and the bulk quantities of copper that were being exchanged. The discovery off the coast of Anatolia at Ulu Burun of a Late Bronze Age shipwreck with a cargo of over ten tons of Cypriot copper ingots provides remarkable confirmation of the extensive international metals trade in which Cyprus clearly played an important role.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_and_roman_art/copper_ingot//objectview.aspx?OID=130008969&amp;collID=13&amp;dd1=13 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/greek_...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: copper,ElissaSCA: ingot,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: age,3D,Artwork,AccessionInDesc,Description,DescriptionInDesc"

These elongaged S-shaped channels were a popular form of relief decoration on vases and sarcophagi, especially in the second half of the 2nd century and the 3rd century AD. Two bearded snakes form the handle on either side of the vase. With their upper bodies coiled on the broad shoulder, they stretch their flat heads forward across the deep concavity of the neck to bite the projecting rim, setting up a play of spatial depth and light and dark effects.

Purchased through a gift from The Annenberg Foundation, the group consists of a container for offerings known as a kernos, a tall jar, and a jug.;;&quot;These works are spectacular additions to the Metropolitan Museum's Cycladic collection,&quot; stated Philippe de Montebello, Director of the Metropolitan Museum. &quot;They are powerful as works of art, representing the potter's expertise at its most accomplished, and also serve as rich sources of information about Cycladic culture and its interrelations with neighboring areas such as Crete. Thanks to the generosity of The Annenberg Foundation, the Museum's holdings have been strengthened immeasurably by this acquisition. This is particularly welcome at this crucial time, as the Department of Greek and Roman Art, led by Carlos Picon, is carrying out extensive renovations of their galleries and reinstallation of their collections.&quot;;;The three objects were found together on the Aegean island of Melos in 1829 by a British officer, Captain Richard Copeland, who was surveying in the eastern Mediterranean. They were donated to Eton College in Windsor, England, by Copeland's widow in 1857. The offering vase and the jar were first put on view at the Metropolitan Museum as loans in 1996 on the occasion of the opening of the Robert and Renee Belfer Court, the first phase of the ongoing reinstallation of the Museum's Greek and Roman Galleries. The jug was included in the recent purchase of the group by the Metropolitan. All are now on view together in the Belfer Court, which houses prehistoric and early Greek art.;;The art of the ancient Cycladic islands is most familiar from the elegant marble statuettes, usually of female figures, that were created between about 2800 and 2000 B.C. The same extraordinary level of craftsmanship evident in the statuettes appears in the offering container. Standing 13-5/8 inches high, it consists of a conical stand that supports 25 elongated receptacles, which are connected by a series of small platforms and struts a very early application of the cantilever principle. The two rings of receptacles would probably have contained offerings of natural products such as seeds, grain, fruit, perhaps fibers, and so on. The decoration consists of lines that emphasize the major features of the vase; the blackish-brown glaze is applied over a buff slip that covers the actual surface.;;Although the piece has received some slight repairs, every aspect of its preservation is excellent. Kernoi of this type are associated principally with the island of Melos and have most often been found in tombs. The majority are far simpler, with between three and 12 receptacles. Only a handful of kernoi compare closely with the example now in the Metropolitan Museum; the finest counterparts are in The British Museum, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The newly acquired kernos, arguably the finest preserved, was also the last one in private hands.;;The second object, the jar, probably contained a burial. At 16-3/8 inches in height, it is slightly taller than the kernos. While the shape is well attested, the Eton example is featured throughout the archaeological literature thanks to its superb state of preservation.

(86.4 x 215.9 x 92.1 cm);Purchase, Joseph Pulitzer Bequest, 1955 (55.11.5);;This highly ornate and extremely well-preserved Roman marble sarcophagus came to the Metropolitan Museum from the collection of the dukes of Beaufort and was formerly displayed in their country seat, Badminton Hall in Gloucestershire, England. An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall).

Most likely, the figure standing under a parasol in the first chariot represents the deceased. His horses, like the others, are richly caparisoned, but the wheels of his chariot have fewer spokes. Splendidly embellished horses and chariot poles are part of a long tradition on Cyprus, although scholars have suggested that the prototypes for the chariot procession on the Amathus sarcophagus may have been Graeco-Persian reliefs.;;One of the short sides of the sarcophagus originally was decorated with four figures of the Egyptian god Bes. The cult of Bes was especially popular at Amathus, primarily because of the Phoenician presence in the city. The other short side of the sarcophagus shows four standing figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte. Nude except for their ornate necklaces, the four figures of the goddess hold their breasts in a pose that is well attested in Cypriot terracotta sculpture from the sixth century B.C. The temple of Astarte, located on the acropolis of Amathus, was one of the most important sanctuaries on Cyprus. The depictions of Bes and Astarte on this particular sarcophagus suggest the importance of procreation to the deceased.;;Most of the architectural moldings and the decorative details on the sarcophagus, such as the carved palmettes and ivy leaves that fill the four panels, are of eastern Greek origin. Other floral motifs, such as the tree of life and a frieze of lotus flowers and buds, had a long tradition in Cypriot vase painting and other arts of the Archaic and later periods. The figural panels are framed by a variety of vegetal ornaments, while the gabled lid once featured a pair of sphinxes and a palmette at each end. The thorough integration of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Cypriot stylistic elements on the Amathus sarcophagus is characteristic of Cypriot art and culture during the fifth century B.C.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm</a>  addl Accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Artwork,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,AccessionInDesc"

The artist John Vanderlyn (17751852) had visited Versailles a few years earlier and made sketches to prepare his giant canvas. The panorama was first exhibited in a special building called the Rotunda located near City Hall in downtown New York, and subsequently toured around the country. The artist depicted himself, pointing at Czar Alexander I and the king of Prussia standing around the Basin of Latona, beneath the garden facade of the palace. In addition to the remarkably precise rendering of the palace itself, Vanderlyn provides a detailed view over the main axis, or Allee Royale, to the Grand Canal, now appearing somewhat forlorn without Louis XIV's pleasure boats. A comparison of Vanderlyn's early nineteenth-century rendering of the Versailles gardens and Adam Perelle's seventeenth-century prints (20.41.126) shows that, in spite of the slightly barren look of the grounds and lack of floral detail in parterres, the layout of the garden remains essentially as Andre Le Notre designed it in the late seventeenth century.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gard_2/ho_52.184.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gard_2/ho_52.184.htm</a>  addl Accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: painting,ElissaSCA: 19thcentury,Artwork,2D,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,AccessionInDesc"

In this role crocodiles represented cosmic and regenerative powers, and might accompany deities such as Isis.;;During Hellenistic and Roman times the cults of the Egyptian gods Isis and Serapis, along with elements of their Egyptian iconography including the crocodile, spread widely throughout the Mediterranean and reached Rome itself. Placed in the context of Roman art, crocodile images served primarily to evoke the Nilotic environment. This superb sculpture serves the same function today at the temple of Dendur. ;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: crocodile,ElissaSCA: animal,3D,Artwork,Description,AccessionInDesc,MetropolitanInDesc"

(96.5 x 68.6 cm);Rogers Fund, 1919 (19.186);;Buddhist images executed in dry lacquer were highly valued by the Chinese because of their costly and time-consuming process of production. There are so few surviving examples that this seated Buddha is especially precious. To fashion the body of the image, the craftsman made a rough form of the sculpture in clay and then applied at least three layers of hemp cloth, each secured with a paste made of raw lacquer (the sap from the lac tree, Rhus verniciflua) and a fine powder of bone, horn, shell, ceramic, stone, or carbon. Each layer had to dry thoroughly before the next could be added. The clay core was then removed from the lacquered image. The head and hands were likely modeled separately, using the same technique as that used for the body, and then attached to the sculpture. The surface was finished with several coatings of pure lacquer and then painted.;;Portrayed as a youthful figure, the Buddha sits in the full lotus position, with his legs tightly interlocked, though the lower part of the sculpture is missing. The position of the damaged arms suggests that the hands performed the gesture of contemplation. The columnar form and lean gracefulness of the figure recall the style of Buddhist sculpture of the late Period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386589), but the attempt to render anatomical differentiation and, in particular, the emotional impact of the Buddha's expression are distinguishing features of early Tang style. The traces of brilliant red and blue, vividly combined to form a stylized floral pattern in the hem of the undergarment crossing the chest, and the remains of shimmering gilt on the surface are evidence of the sumptuous effect of this once colorful figure.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/eac/hod_19.186.htm</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2009,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: asian,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: buddha,ElissaSCA: chinese,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,3D,Artwork,AccessionInDesc,Description"

Clytie gazed inconsolably at the sun for nine days, languishing nude, without food or drink. For her constancy, she was changed into a sunflower so that her face would forever follow the sun as it moved across the sky. Rinehart subtly evoked Ovids story by depicting a drooping sunflower in Clyties right hand. The tree stump with live sunflower plants serves both to enhance the narrative and to offer tensile support for the marble figure.;;;From the placard: Metropolitan Museum of Art.;;;<b><a href=http://classics.mit.edu/Ovid/metam.4.fourth.html rel=nofollow>Ovid Metamorphoses Book IV <a></a></a></b>;;  addl Accession","rverc: clytie,rverc: americanwing,rverc: metropolitanmueum,rverc: art,rverc: nyc,3D,Artwork,Description,MetropolitanInDesc,AccessionInDesc"

Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale, Main Reception Hall;;left to right: Seated woman playing a kithara, enthroned couple (pictured here), woman holding a child;;These three large panels probably celebrate a dynastic marriage. At the left is a seated woman playing a kithara, a large stringed instrument; she must be an important personage at the court, for she wears a diadem and sits on a throne-like chair. The child who leans over her shoulder may also be a member of the ruling family. The wedded couple occupy the central panel. The ruler is shown in conventional heroic nudity, while his wife appears pensive, as brides in ancient art were often represented. The woman at the right is probably an oracle predicting the birth of a male heir, the future king. The image of a nude man wearing the white band that served as crown for Hellenistic rulers appears as a reflection in her shield.;;**;The April 20, 2007 unveiling of the 30,000 square foot Greek and Roman Galleries concluded a 15-year project and returned thousands of works from the Museums permanent collection to public view.

SET 20,2099221652.jpg,20.192.17,-,wallyg,"<i>Wall painting from a cubiculum nocturnum (bedroom)</i>; last decade of the 1st century B.C.; Early Imperial, Augustan; Third Style;Roman;Fresco; H. 73 3/4 in. (187.33 cm.) width 47 in. (119.38 cm.);;This fresco once decorated the west wall of bedroom 19, the Mythological Room, in the Imperial Villa at Boscotrecase. Third-Style Roman bedrooms were often adorned with mythological scenes that apparently imitated the framed paintings that hung in Roman houses. This example shows the Cyclops Polyphemus as the unsuccessful suitor of the lovely sea nymph Galatea, who rides a dolphin at the lower left. Polyphemus is seated in the center of a rocky outcrop, professing his desire for Galatea with a melody on his panpipe, but to no avail. As told by Ovid, Galatea hid with her lover Acis, the son of Pan, while she listened to the Cyclop's song, but he discovered them and rose in rage, crushing Acis under a boulder as he tried to escape. This wall painting comes from a bedroom in the imperial villa uncovered between 1902 and 1905 near the modern town of Boscotrecase, not far from Pompeii. The walls were predominately red and a large mythological painting filled the center on each side of the room. The painting seen here combines two separate incidents in the life of the monstrous, one-eyed giant, Polyphemus. In the foreground he sits on a rocky projection guarding his goats and gazing at Galatea, the beautiful sea-nymph with whom he is hopelessly in love. Behind and above to the right, he is seen again, hurling a boulder at the departing ship of Odysseus, who has escaped with his men from the giant's cave after blinding him. The landscape painting in the same room includes two consecutive incidents in the story of Perseus and Andromeda. At the front Perseus flies in to rescue the princess who is chained to a rock at the mercy of a seamonster; above to the right the happy couple are welcomed by her grateful parents. The fortunes of love and the ever-present sea are the themes linking these two works. The combination of disparate episodes in one panel was a bold innovation when these were painted. The translucent blue-green background tone unifies these magical landscapes and must have brought a sense of coolness to the room. ;;Rogers Fund, 1920 (20.192.17);;**;The April 20, 2007 unveiling of the 30,000 square foot Greek and Roman Galleries concluded a 15-year project and returned thousands of works from the Museums permanent collection to public view.

In early November, wearing the regional costume of the legendary dark-haired beauties of Arles, she posed for both Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh was thrilled to &quot;have an Arlesienne at last&quot; and quickly &quot;slashed on in an hour&quot; his first, more summarily executed version of this portrait (Musee d'Orsay, Paris), using the thick jute canvas that Gauguin had brought with him to Arles. Later, Van Gogh enhanced that image by adorning the tabletop with two accessories befitting an Arlesienne: a parasol and gloves. Those finishing touches were probably added in December 1888 or January 1889, when he revisited the composition to use it as the prototype for the Museum's painting.

Religious cults were revived, temples were built, public ceremonies and sacrifices filled the calendar. Men of every rank chose to be portrayed in the act of pious sacrifice. The popular type of sculpture seen here showed young boys who served as acolytes at religious ceremonies.;;The identification of this figure as a camillus, an attendant at sacrifices who was chosen from the noblest families, is based on comparisons with other stages and reliefs, most notably those of the famous monument, the Ara Pacis of Augustus. According to Roman tradition, a camillus had to be below the age of puberty, and both parents must be alive. This statue may have been dedicated at a sanctuary by the boy's parents, in recognition of his service to the gods. Alternatively, its refined decorative qualities may signal its use as an adornment within a religious precinct, for instance in a dining room for priests. ;;The figure's eyes are inlaid with silver, the lips with copper, and the tunic with strips of copper to suggest woven or embroidered bands of color.

Both the plaque and the elaborate frame pay homage to the flourishing of the decorative arts that took place during the French Renaissance. The scene on the plaque, by Nicolas-Marie Moriot after a painting by Charles Alexandre Debacq (18041853), portrays the Renaissance pottery Bernard Palissy burning the furniture in his house to fire his kiln. The oval enamel-on-copper plaques that decorate the frame depict events from Palissy's life, and their grisaille decoration evokes Limoges enamels of the sixteenth century. The plaques were painted by Jacob Meyer-Heine, who was named head of the recently established enamel workshop at Sevres in 1840. The dragons entwined with strapwork on the gilt-bronze frame by Armande Feuchere are drawn from the architectural vocabulary of the French Renaissance, and the biscuit porcelain figures modeled by Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann (18101867) recall the stucco decoration of the Galerie Francois I at Fontainebleau, the supreme example of Renaissance art in France.

Delacroix may have first contemplated the subject of &quot;Ovid among the Scythians&quot; around 1835; his earliest treatment of it was as a pendentive in his decoration for the Palais Bourbon, Paris. ;;When the largest version of &quot;Ovid among the Scythians&quot; (now in the National Gallery, London) was exhibited at the 1859 Paris Salon, the unusual composition and strange scale of figures provoked criticism in the press, even among Delacroix's admirers (Baudelaire and Gautier, among others), although artists like Edgar Degas were deeply impressed.

It comes at the beginning of a figural tradition characterized by extreme simplification and symbolic strength. Represented is a standing female with a role of fat and deep groove emphasizing the belly and a clearly indicated pubic triangle. Her massive body is contained within a quadrangular space. The legs look truncated but the toes, like the hands and fingers, are indicated by incisions. She wears a strap across her body and a necklace. Subject and style invite comparison with Near Eastern and Aegean Neolithic statuary and with much later South Arabian statuary of the second century B.C. In early Anatolia and Greeceas in late Paleolithic Europenude females were dynamic, with curved, exaggeraged breasts, belly, and buttocks. By contrast, the frontal, profile, and back planes of the South Arabian sculpture are separated, emphasizing abstraction and containment within a blocklike formfeatures that characterize figural art of the region more than two thousand years later. Other similar statues were found near western highland settlements and the inner Hadramawt area. A few males appear ithyphallic, suggesting that these human or divine images were used in fertility rituals. ;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/ancient_near_eastern_art/standing_female_figure_wearing_a_strap_and_a_necklace//objectview.aspx?OID=30006233&amp;collID=3&amp;dd1=3 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/ancien...</a>","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2010,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: neareast,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

(306.1 x 145.4 x 73 cm);Gift of James C. Melvin, 1915 (15.75);;As early as 1897, Daniel Chester French was at work on a commission from James C. Melvin, a Boston businessman, to design a war monument honoring his three brothers who had died in the Civil War. In 1908, the Melvin Memorial was erected in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, Massachusetts, and is considered by many to be French's greatest war monument, if not his finest ideal work. Four years later, Melvin offered to fund a marble replica for the Metropolitan Museum, which was subsequently carved by the Piccirilli Brothers and installed in the Museum in 1915. French merged innovative technique and symbolic content in Mourning Victory, as he called the figure of the angel. She emerges from a cavity of a rectangular marble shaft, flesh from stone, darkness into light. The partial nude strides forward with hair and drapery swirling around her. The tip of a wing is visible near her knee. In one outstretched hand she holds a branch of laurel, while in the other she lifts above her head an American flag, its stars decisively rendered. This charged physical movement maintains a carefully orchestrated emotional balance with the melancholy restraint of the angel's downcast eyes.;;The Museum's version relates more closely to French's original model, because in the final design for the Melvin Memorial the figure was reversed. Apparently, the approach to the outdoor monument brought Mourning Victory's upraised arm in front of her face, nearly hiding it from that vantage point.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.   addl accession On view in Gallery 700","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: art,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: museum,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: publicart,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: unitedstates,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

The original bronze statue, cast in Paris in 1892, was erected the following year in Forest Hills Cemetery, in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. When the plaster model was shown at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, it received acclaim that assured French's status at the forefront of his profession. In 1917, the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Robert W. de Forest, asked French, who was also a Museum trustee, about acquiring a replica of the bronze. French contracted the Piccirilli Brothers, New York's leading firm of marble carvers, to carve the statue in marble.

(86.4 x 215.9 x 92.1 cm);;Description;This highly ornate and extremely well-preserved Roman marble sarcophagus came to the Metropolitan Museum from the collection of the dukes of Beaufort and was formerly displayed in their country seat, Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England. An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). The figures are unusual in that the Seasons are usually portrayed as women, but here they are shown as sturdy youths. Around these five central figures are placed other Bacchic figures and cultic objects, all carved at a smaller scale. On the rounded ends of the sarcophagus are two other groups of large figures, similarly intermingled with lesser ones. On the left end, Mother Earth is portrayed reclining on the ground; she is accompanied by a satyr and a youth carrying fruit. On the right end, a bearded male figure, probably to be identified with the personification of a river-god, reclines in front of two winged youths, perhaps representing two additional Seasons. ;;The sarcophagus is an exquisite example of Roman funerary art, displaying all the virtuosity of the workshop where it was carved. The marble comes from a quarry in the eastern Mediterranean and was probably shipped to Rome, where it was worked. Only a very wealthy and powerful person would have been able to commission and purchase such a sarcophagus, and it was probably made for a member of one of the old aristocratic families in Rome itself. The subjects - the triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons - are unlikely, however, to have had any special significance for the deceased, particularly as it is clear that the design was copied from a sculptor's pattern book. Another sarcophagus, now in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Kassel, Germany, has the same composition of Dionysos flanked by the four Seasons, although the treatment and carving of the figures is quite different. On the Badminton sarcophagus the figures are carved in high relief and so endow the crowded scene with multiple areas of light and shade, allowing the eye to wander effortlessly from one figure to another. One must also imagine that certain details were highlighted with color and even gilding, making the whole composition a visual tour de force.;;Very few Roman sarcophagi of this quality have survived. Although the Badminton sarcophagus lacks its lid, the fact that it was found in the early eighteenth century and soon thereafter installed in Badminton Hall means that it has been preserved almost intact and only a few of the minor extremities are now missing.  addl accession Marble sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons Date: ca.

This canvas is one of a small group of drawings and paintings by Gericault (in various private collections) that depict Alfred and his sister, Elisabeth, two years his junior. Alfred became a painter, and like Gericault, was enamored of horses and equestrian sports.

David shows him calmly discoursing on the immortality of the soul with his grief-stricken disciples. Painted in 1787, the picture, with its stoic theme, is perhaps David's most perfect Neoclassical statement. The printmaker and publisher John Boydell wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds that it was &quot;the greatest effort of art since the Sistine Chapel and the stanze of Raphael. . . . This work would have done honour to Athens at the time of Pericles.&quot; The subject is loosely based on Plato's Phaedo, but in painting it David consulted a variety of sources, including Diderot's treatise on dramatic poetry of 1758 and works by the poet Andre Chenier.

Over the decade, Pissarro developed his approach to landscape painting, adapting the looser touch, broken brush strokes and lighter palette of his younger Impressionist colleagues. He also enjoyed contact with Cezanne, who lived in nearby Auvers. With characteristic interest in the pulse of daily life, Pissarro routinely painted inhabited, as opposed to pure, landscapes, frequently depicting villages walking on paths through the French countryside.;Formerly known as A Cowherd on the Route du Chou, Pontoise, this view actually shows the rue de Pontoise in the adjacent hamlet of Valhermeil in Auvers. Between 1873 and 1882, Pissarro painted some twenty works in the area, including a half dozen in which the red-roofed house adds a contrasting color note to the hillsides lush greenery.;;Gift of Edna H.

Gudin le Jeune was among the clockmakers who supplied movements for clocks of this variety, and there is at least one payment in Duvaux's records from Gudin in 1753 for a Meissen porcelain group. It is not the group found on this clock, however, which has a complicated history of its own; it is composed of a group called the Hand Kiss and a separate figure titled Shindler, the Huzzar of Count Heinrich von Bruhl. Both porcelains were modeled at Meissen by Johann Joachim Kaendler (1706-1775) between 1735 and 1737, and the Hand Kiss appeared in several versions, one in which a tea table replaces the cavalier. On this clock the porcelain group is mounted on an exuberantly rococo French gilded-bronze that also supports the stem of a bush laden with flowers (made about 1745-49) at the French porcelain manufactory at Vincennes) encircling the dial of the clock. Peeping from the underbrush at the twelve o'clock position is a porcelain cat with a dead bird.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.;","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: clock,ElissaSCA: porcelain,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: french,ElissaSCA: rococo,AccessionInDesc,Description,3D,Artwork"

Michael Paul Foundation Inc. Gift and Charles Ulrick and Josephine Bay Foundation Inc. Gift, and Fletcher Fund, 1967 (67.250);;Dante's Divine Comedy has always enjoyed favor in the plastic arts. Ugolino, the character that galvanized peoples' fantasies and fears during the second half of the nineteenth century, appears in Canto 33 of the Inferno. This intensely Romantic sculpture derives from the passage in which Dante describes the imprisonment in 1288 and subsequent death by starvation of the Pisan count Ugolino della Gherardesca and his offspring. Carpeaux depicts the moment when Ugolino, condemned to die of starvation, yields to the temptation to devour his children and grandchildren, who cry out to him:;;But when to our somber cell was thrown;A slender ray, and each face was lit;I saw in each the aspect of my own,;For very grief both of my hands I bit,;And suddenly from the floor arising they,;Thinking my hunger was the cause of it,;Exclaimed: Father eat thou of us, and stay;Our suffering: thou didst our being dress;In this sad flesh; now strip it all away.;;Carpeaux's visionary composition reflects his reverence for Michelangelo, as well as his own painstaking concern with anatomical realism. Ugolino and His Sons was completed in plaster in 1861, the last year of his residence at the French Academy in Rome. A sensation in Rome, it brought Carpeaux many commissions. Upon his return to France, Ugolino was cast in bronze at the order of the French Ministry of Fine Arts and exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1863. Later it was moved to the gardens of the Tuilieries, where it was displayed as a pendant to a bronze of the Laocoon. This marble version was executed by the practitioner Bernard under Carpeaux's supervision and completed in time for the Universal Exposition at Paris in 1867. The date inscribed on the marble refers to the original plaster model's completion;;Source: Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux: Ugolino and His Sons (67.250) | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art;  addl accession","Stephen Sandoval: themet,Stephen Sandoval: multipleexposure,Stephen Sandoval: metropolitanmuseumofart,Stephen Sandoval: ugolinoandhissons,Description,Stylized,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

Harkness, 1917 (17.9.1);;This well-formed statuette of a hippopotamus demonstrates the Egyptian artist's appreciation for the natural world. It was molded in faience, a ceramic material made of ground quartz. Beneath the blue-green glaze, the body was painted with the outlines of river plants, symbolizing the marshes in which the animal lived.; ;The seemingly benign appearance that this figurine presents is deceptive. To the ancient Egyptians, the hippopotamus was one of the most dangerous animals in their world. The huge creatures were a hazard for small fishing boats and other rivercraft. The beast might also be encountered on the waterways in the journey to the afterlife. As such, the hippopotamus was a force of nature that needed to be propitiated and controlled, both in this life and the next. This example was one of a pair found in a shaft associated with the tomb chapel of the steward Senbi II at Meir, an Upper Egyptian site about thirty miles south of modern Asyut. Three of its legs have been restored because they were purposely broken to prevent the creature from harming the deceased. The hippo was part of Senbi's burial equipment, which included a canopic box (also in the Metropolitan Museum), a coffin, and numerous models of boats and food production.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/hippopotamus/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100000444 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: egypt,ElissaSCA: egyptian,ElissaSCA: faience,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: statuette,ElissaSCA: figurine,ElissaSCA: hippo,ElissaSCA: blue,Description,3D,Artwork"

Perls Collection, 1997;;Accession Number: 1997.149.9;;Description: ;;Born to a once-prosperous Jewish merchant family in Italy, Amedeo Modigliani grew up in a cultured but financially strained environment in Livorno. A severe bout of pleurisy ended his formal schooling at age fourteen, and he was plagued by poor health for the rest of his short life; he died of tuberculosis at age thirty-five. From 1902 to 1906 Modigliani studied painting with the Italian artist Guglielmo Micheli (a proponent of plein-air painting) and visited Capri, Naples, Florence, Venice, and Rome. In 1906 he moved permanently to Paris, where he frequented artists' gatherings and became friends with other expatriate artists living in France, such as Chaim Soutine and Moise Kisling. Modigliani was a prolific artist, producing some 420 paintings, innumerable drawings, and 31 sculptures between 1906 and 1920.;;His celebrated series of nudes continues the tradition of depictions of Venuses from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century but with one significant difference: the eroticism of the earlier figures is always couched within a mythological or anecdotal context, whereas Modigliani does away with this pretext. Consequently, his women appear unabashedly frank and provocative. ;;The artist is best known for the works that he created in Paris between 1915 and 1919 portraits, in which a few telling details achieve a striking likeness, and nudes. Modigliani began his great series of reclining women in 1916. The two dozen or so figures never his mistresses or friends but always professional models lie on a dark bed cover that accentuates the glow of their skin; they are seen close-up and usually from above.

Van Gogh noted that in the &quot;two canvases representing big bunches of violet irises,&quot; he placed &quot;one lot against a pink background&quot; and the other &quot;against a startling citron yellow background&quot; to exploit the play of &quot;disparate complementaries.&quot; Owing to the use of a fugitive red pigment, the &quot;soft and harmonious&quot; effect that he had sought in the Metropolitan's painting through the &quot;combination of greens, pinks, violets&quot; has been altered by the fading of the once pink background to almost white.

The armor was subsequently given to William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, Henry's esquire and an executor of his will. It is recorded at Wilton House, seat of the Pembroke family, from 1558 until it was sold in the 1920s.

SET 29,1053572930.jpg,5.3,-,ElissaSCA,"In a time when emperors were hard-pressed to maintain their position of power, some ruled for as little as a few months and in many ways were wholly dependent on the fickle attitudes of their armies. Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expressionall of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 21117 A.D.) (40.11.1a).;;Reconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. ;;The overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor. In fact, the boots Gallus wears are of a type often shown in representations of boxers, and would have been more appropriate for the palaestra, or exercise yard, than the imperial court.;;Although his pose is one routinely adopted by Roman emperorsrecalling Greek heroic and athletic nude statuesthe disproportion, wrestling gear, brutish crew cut, and stubble beard no longer evoke the ideals of classical Greece as in the days of Augustus.

(53.3 cm);;Once part of a larger retinue, this elegant dancer is extraordinarily compelling in her ability to convey a feeling of life in a perfectly motionless form. The sculptor chose the moment in the performance when one sleeve is thrown back as the dancer gently stoops and flexes her knees, lifting one heel from the floor; she is motionless for a split second before she advances on her toes, her pendant arm remaining supremely still. The desire for an afterlife through which worldly pleasures and activities are maintained is reflected in the placing of models (known as spirit goods, or &quot;mingqi&quot;) of attendants, entertainers, pets, domestic animals, and a host of worldly goods in Chinese tombs, particularly during the first millennium. Tomb furnishings reflected the wealth, status, and interests of the deceased, while equipping tombs with such items was often understood as an act of homage by the deceased's family and descendants. Although certain spirit goods were made of bronze, jade, and other materials, clay was most commonly used. ;;Charlotte C. and John C. Weber Collection, Gift of Charlotte C. and John C.

Gift, 1975 (1975.268.164, 165);;In Buddhist temples, images of the Buddha are venerated on altars that represent Mount Sumeru, considered to be the center of the mythic Indian universe. An alcove recessed in the ceiling above transforms into architecture the parsol or canopy that sheltered persons of high estate. Hanging ornaments refer to floral garlands worn by the elite and bestowed in veneration on sacred images.;;This altar--a railed rectangular wooden platform backed by a planked wall between two pillars--represents a Japanese style of Buddhist architecture. It is a replica of the altar at a twelth century Amida Hall at Fuki-ji in K yushi built in 1986 using traditional material and techniques by the Kyoto firm Yasui Kamokuten, under the direction of architectural historian Kakichi Suzuki. At its center is the golden image of Dainichi Nyori, the supreme Buddha of the cosmos in esoteric Buddhist thought. He is the source from whom all other deities and everything in the universe emanate, as light does from the sun. His hands form the mystic gesture (mudra) of perfect knowledge, which holds the powe to restrain passions that hinder enlightenment. With the left index finger surrounded and protected by the fingers of the right, this gesture expresses the all-encompassing union of the spiritual and material realms of being. At one time the sculpture also had a crown over the topknot adorned with images of five Buddhas, representing Dainchi's five forms. In keeping with the occult nature of this image, mystery and introspection suffuse its features. Graceful proportions made possible by a new technique of carving and assembling sculpture in sections are characteristic of images of the later Heain period, when courtly aesthetics were paramount. In the glow of its original gold-leaf covering, this Dainichi must have appeared to embody his name, the Buddha of the Great Raddiance of Illumination.;;Standing sentinel at the corners of the platform are two armored figures of menacing mien. They are from a set of the Guarrdian Kings of the Four Directions, Hindu demigods who were absorbed into the Buddhist pantheon as protectors of the teaching. Their stocky figures retain the massive strength of an early Heian style and were carved from single blocks of wood. Only the arms, now missing, were carved separately.;;**;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.

Young Mada's portrait was executed in 1912. A series of preliminary pencil sketches, now in public and private collections, show that as the composition evolved, the artist experimented with alternative poses and background motifs. Ultimately, he selected an open, painterly treatment that contrasts with the highly stylized designs adapted for the backgrounds of his fin-de-siecle portraits. The lighthearted, decorative motifs seem particularly appropriate to a nine-year-old sitter.&quot;;<a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/ho_64.148.htm rel=nofollow>Met Museum</a>  addl accession","Marina Alexis Parker: gustavklimt,Marina Alexis Parker: madaprimavesi,Marina Alexis Parker: 1912,Marina Alexis Parker: potrait,Marina Alexis Parker: painting,Marina Alexis Parker: austrianartist,Marina Alexis Parker: viennasecessionmovement,Marina Alexis Parker: metropolitanmuseumofart,Marina Alexis Parker: metmuseum,Marina Alexis Parker: newyorkcity,Description,2D,Artwork"

These influences remain evident in The Terrace at Vernon, which he began in 1920 and reworked in 1939. This painting of his house in the Seine Valley reveals an intricate spatial organization.

His flamboyance, flair for drama and self-promotion, and hyperactive imagination reinvigorated the movement and its public popularity. Dali, who was given to hallucinations and paranoiac visions, cultivated these outrageous subjects for his paintings, rendering them so meticulously that they were unsettling in their clinical matter-of-factness. Such pictures exemplified the Surrealist preoccupation with dreams and the unconscious.;;;Painted in the summer of 1929, &quot;The Accommodations of Desire&quot; is a small gem that deals with Dali's sexual anxieties over a love affair with an older, married woman. The woman, Gala, then the wife of the Surrealist poet Paul Eluard, became Dali's life-long muse and mate. In this picture, which Dali painted after taking a walk alone with Gala, he included seven enlarged pebbles on which he envisioned what lay ahead for him: &quot;terrorizing&quot; lions' heads (not so &quot;accommodating&quot; to his &quot;desires&quot; as the title of the painting facetiously suggests), as well as a toupee and a colony of ants (a symbol of decay). Also depicted are various vessels (one in the shape of a woman's head) and three figures embracing on a platform. Dali did not paint the lion heads but, rather, cut them out from what must have been an illustrated children's book, slyly matching the latter's detailed style with his own. These collaged elements are virtually indistinguishable from the super-saturated color and painstaking realism of the rest of the composition, startling the viewer into questioning the existence of the phenomena recorded and of the representation as a whole.","Maulleigh: the,Maulleigh: accommodations,Maulleigh: salvador,Maulleigh: dali,Maulleigh: 1929,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: met,AccessionInDesc,Description,2D,Artwork"

(241.3 x 156.8 cm), , On January 18, 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania passed a resolution commissioning a portrait of George Washington for the Council Chamber and selected Charles Willson Peale as the artist. In preparation, Peale traveled to the Princeton and Trenton battlefields in February of 1779 to make sketches for the background. The original portrait, the full-length version now in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (in Philadelphia), was a tremendous success and Peale completed numerous copies for royal palaces abroad, each time updating the general's military dress. This figure of George Washington was probably painted between June and August of 1780. In every other version, Washington is shown after the Battle of Princeton, but here he is depicted after the Battle of Trenton, the turning point of the war. It has been suggested that this portrait was commissioned upon the order of Mrs. Washington, because it is the only portrait in which Washington wears his state sword and because the painting descended in the Washington family., , Gift of Collis P.

(76.8 x 64.1 cm), , This portrait of President Washington, called the Gibbs-Channing-Avery portrait, is one of eighteen similar works known as the Vaughan group. The first of this type, presumably painted from life and then copied in all the others, originally belonged to Samuel Vaughan, a London merchant living in Philadelphia and a close friend of Washington. This original portrait by Stuart, painted in 1795 according to Rembrandt Peale, was subsequently acquired by Joseph Harrison of Philadelphia. While in Harrison's collection, Rembrandt Peale copied it many times. The version now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, considered to be one of the earliest and best replicas, was sold to Stuart's close friend, Colonel George Gibbs, and subsequently descended in the Gibbs family., , Stuart's portraits of Washington are at once lifelike and iconic. This portrait was one of Stuart's first likenesses of the president and reveals the extent to which Washington was apotheosized even before his death in 1799. It is characterized by a looseness of flesh appropriate to his age. Yet Stuart also expertly modeled the skin tones with blue-gray shadows so that Washington's face seems marble-like. He appears authoritative and aristocratic, an impression further emphasized by the exaggerated eyebrows. The fantastic blen of hues in the background effectively completes the monumental image., , Rogers Fund, 1907 (07.160) , , **, The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.

Harkness, 1917 (17.9.1), , This well-formed statuette of a hippopotamus demonstrates the Egyptian artist's appreciation for the natural world. It was molded in faience, a ceramic material made of ground quartz. Beneath the blue-green glaze, the body was painted with the outlines of river plants, symbolizing the marshes in which the animal lived., , The seemingly benign appearance that this figurine presents is deceptive. To the ancient Egyptians, the hippopotamus was one of the most dangerous animals in their world. The huge creatures were a hazard for small fishing boats and other rivercraft. The beast might also be encountered on the waterways in the journey to the afterlife. As such, the hippopotamus was a force of nature that needed to be propitiated and controlled, both in this life and the next. This example was one of a pair found in a shaft associated with the tomb chapel of the steward Senbi II at Meir, an Upper Egyptian site about thirty miles south of modern Asyut. Three of its legs have been restored because they were purposely broken to prevent the creature from harming the deceased. The hippo was part of Senbi's burial equipment, which included a canopic box (also in the Metropolitan Museum), a coffin, and numerous models of boats and food production., , Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/hippopotamus/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100000444 rel=nofollow>www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egypti...</a>  addl accession","'ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: art, ElissaSCA: met, ElissaSCA: mma, ElissaSCA: manhattan, ElissaSCA: newyork, ElissaSCA: newyorkcity, ElissaSCA: ny, ElissaSCA: nyc, ElissaSCA: 2008, ElissaSCA: ancient, ElissaSCA: ancientworld, ElissaSCA: sculpture, ElissaSCA: egypt, ElissaSCA: egyptian, ElissaSCA: faience, ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd, ElissaSCA: statuette, ElissaSCA: figurine, ElissaSCA: hippo, ElissaSCA: blue,','ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum, ElissaSCA: museum, ElissaSCA: ar,Description,3D,Artwork"

Here, using sharp tonal contrasts of ink and white paper, Xu's swift rendition of this noble steel embodies the spirit of a tradition &quot;ink play.&quot; The horse's naturalistic pose is deftly captured in abbreviated brushwork. The chiaroscuro modeling of its form is more subjective than scientific, but the horse's accurate anatomy and the convincing foreshortening of its body reflect Xu's solid grounding in Western academic art. The hauteur of the unleashed, unmounted animal is essentially Western in character, whereas its mane and tail, blowing unnaturally in opposite directions, attests to the artist's ultimately subjective (Chinese) approach.;;Xu's passionate images of horses, a traditional symbol of Chinese martial spirit, were intended to inspire patriotic resistance during the Sino-Japanese War. Here, for example, the artist reveals his own sense of frustration by adding a poem by Du Fu (712-770) that describes a famous breed of war horses that had been put to pasture because of their old age despite their continued willingness to fight:;;<i>Nanshi [in Gansu province] is a congenial habitat for heavenly horses;;Tens of thousands of them are always stalwart.;Floating clouds expand across the vast frontier;;Autumn grasses grow tall over the mountains;I have heard that the pure bloodline of dragon horses;Lives on in the aging Sushuang horse.;Neighing sadly longing to fight,;It stands tall facing the sky.</i>;;Partial and Promised Gift of Richard M.

They were mass-produced, often near the source of the contents they carried, and were designed to have a standard capacity, sometimes guaranteed by a maker's stamp on the handle or neck. Painted inscriptions were often added to include the nature, origin, and amount, of an amphora's contents. Amphorae have a distinctive, practical shape usually a narrow neck that could be sealed during transportation, two handles for ease of lifting and carrying by hand (as, for example, during the loading or unloading of a ship), and a rounded or cylindrical body with a pointed base to allow them to be stacked in multiple rows.;;An idea of the amount of produce that was imported to feed the inhabitants of Rome is given by Monte Testaccio, a man-made hill of discarded amphorae on the outskirts of the ancient city near the Tiber River, where the jars were unloaded and their contents transferred to smaller containers. Most of the surface shards on Monte Testaccio belong to a specific type of amphora known as Dressel 20, which was used to bring olive oil from Baetica in southern Spain.;;Amphorae remained in use until the end of antiquity, but the severe decline in trade throughout the Mediterranean in the seventh century AD put an end to the mass production of both contents and containers.

(154.6 x 209.9 cm);;Nicolas Poussin produced two major works telling the the story of The Rape of the Sabine Women, an episode in the legendary early history of Rome narrated by Livy and Plutarch ('Lives' II, 15 and 19). The other version, produced in 1637-8, now at the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157602250625298/>Musee du Louvre</a>, shows a more developed architectural setting. This one belonged to the he marechal de Crequy and seems to date about June 1633 to July 1634, when he was French ambassador to Rome. ;;The Rape, from the Latin rapere, meaning to grab, or steal (and later translating into sexually assaulting, presumably from the idea of stealing virtue), refers to an even that occured shortly after Rome's founding by Romulus and a mostly male group of followers. Seeking wives to found families, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring Sabines, who refused to allow their woman to marry Romans for fear of a rival culture. Faced with the extinction of their communicty, Romulus invited the Sabines to a festival of Neptune Equester. At the meeting Romulus raised his cloak as a prearranged signal for the warriors to seize the women. According to Livy no sexual assault took place. On the contrary, Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights. The women accepted Roman husbands, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. During the Renaissance the subject was popular as a story symbolising the central importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures.;;Poussin depicts Romulus, at the left, giving the signal for the abduction. The mother, her babies, and an old woman in the foreground were captured accidentally in the turmoil. The yellow armor worn by the man at the right is modeled after a Roman &quot;lorica,&quot; which was made of leather and reproduced the anatomy of the male torso. ;;Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, 1946 (46.160);;**;;The <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.

(11.2 x 8.6 x 1.3 cm);Gift John C. Weber in honor of Philippe de Montebello, 2008 (2008.352);;This image of the Virgin of Compassion, or Virgin Eleousa, is a remarkable addition to the limited number of surviving miniature mosaic icons, a medium first popularized in the Late Byzantine era. The intimate gesture of the Christ Child, his head pressed to his mother's cheek, is one of the most beautiful images in Byzantine art. The poses of the heads and the position of the Christ Child's hand (partially restored) are remarkably similar to a less sophisticated, painted icon of the Virgin and Child in the collection of the Monastery of Saint Catherine at Sinai, where the Christ Child also has light brown hair. Another icon from Sinai, which has five small images of named icons including one labeled the Blachernitissa, echoes the head poses and hand gesture seen in this work. An icon donated to the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, Venice, in the seventeenth century and dated to the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century offers a related pose in its exquisite Virgin with an elaborate halo, although the image of the Christ Child differs, as do elements of the design, including the details of the face.;;The Venice icon and the fourteenth-century mosaic icon of Saint Theodore Theron in the Vatican also possess inscriptions in Latin identifying the images. Here the inscription identifies the work as the icon that inspired the conversion in the fourth century of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The saint's vita describes the event: &quot;Then the ascetic gave her an icon on which was depicted the All-holy Theotokos holding the Divine Child in her arms, and said to her . . . take this to your home . . . pray all night . . . the maiden . . . beheld in her vision, the Queen of the angels, just as she was depicted with the Holy child . . . [the maiden] marveling at this vision . . . received from [the ascetic] Holy Baptism.&quot; The desire to possess the icon by which the saint was converted attests to the popularity of Saint Catherine in the West in the Middle Ages. Though the image of the Virgin and Child displayed here was of a type that became popular in the Middle Byzantine centuries, the Latin inscription indicates that Westerners tended to believe that such Byzantine images of the Virgin and Child were copies of works of a much earlier age, if not originals from the fourth century. It cannot be determined if this icon came to the West with a pilgrim from Sinai, where mosaic icons survive today. The Man of Sorrows mosaic icon at Sante Croce in Gerusalemme, in Rome, is said to have been brought to Rome from Sinai. The miniature mosaic at Galatina is housed in a church dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. There was also a church dedicated to Santa Caterina de' Sacchi in Venice, which was established in 1150 and survived in various forms until 1806. It is tempting to think that this work came from the site where Saint Catherine's relics are venerated.;;Text from <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/icon/ho_2008.352.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/icon/ho_2008.352.htm</a>;  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: medieval,ElissaSCA: byzantine,ElissaSCA: icon,ElissaSCA: virgin,ElissaSCA: christian,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: mosaic,ElissaSCA: middleages,DescriptionInDesc,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

He worked primarily as a painter, but also produced drawings, prints, and sculptures that were similarly infused with the energetic movement that symbolized the modern machine age. By 1905, he was already acquainted with two other Italian artists, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Balla rel=nofollow>Giacomo Balla</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Severini rel=nofollow>Gino Severini</a>, who would later join him as the leading painters of Italian <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism rel=nofollow>Futurism</a>, and in 1910 he was one of the signers of the first <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist_Manifesto rel=nofollow>Manifesto</a> of the Futurist Painters and the Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting.;When Boccioni began working in three dimensions in Paris around March 1912, he wrote to a friend: &quot;These days I am obsessed by sculpture!

Considered the most successful of Boccioni's sculptural experiments, this bronze casting was done posthumously in 1949, from the artist's original plaster (which was never cast during his lifetime). As art historian Joshua C. Taylor wrote: &quot;The figure in Unique Forms of Continuity in Space strides forth, a symbol of vitality and strength, yet its impetuous step rests lightly on the ground as if the opposing air gave the figure wings.

Returning to London in 1753, he became the city's busiest fashionable painter. In 1768, he was appointed first president of the Royal Academy; in 1784, principal painter to George III. Reynolds overcame an inadequate grasp of anatomy and perspective with impetuous handling, sonorous color, and a profound understanding of the rhetorical possibilities of pose and gesture.;;The conversation piece came into vogue in Britain in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. A conversation, as it was then called, was a portrait of relatives or friends, at home and at leisure, engaged, as here, in some convivial activity. The genre evolved from seventeenth-century Dutch and contemporary French genre paintings. Small &quot;conversations,&quot; featuring figures twelve to fifteen inches tall, were widely available for modest prices.

(95.2 cm);Bequest of Mary Clark Thompson, 1923 (26.229);;Constantine was the first Christian emperor of Rome, and his reign had a profound effect on the subsequent development of the Roman, and later Byzantine, world. Constantine's reign marked a distinct shift away from the administrative system set up by the emperor Diocletian in 293 A.D., which saw the division of the empire into four territories each governed by one of four imperial partners. This Tetrarchy was founded on the idea of homogeneous authority; all four emperors were depicted together in portraits emphasizing their unity and indivisibility in order to bolster their strength and present the image of a unified empire. Although Diocletian's intent had been to permanently do away with dynastic succession, Constantine's aim was to establish a new dynasty and to found a new capital, named Constantinople after himself. He also succeeded in reunifying the empire with the defeat of the last of his former tetrarchic colleagues, the Eastern emperor Licinius.;Although the court and administration no longer resided at Rome, Constantine was careful not to neglect the old imperial city and adorned it with many new secular and Christian buildings. The most famous of these is the triumphal arch, the Arch of Constantine, which still stands near the Colosseum. This work contains reused material from earlier monuments, a practice that was not only economical but probably also intended to shed reflected glory on the emperor by associating his reign in a very direct and practical way with that of famous &quot;good&quot; emperors from the past. This desire to link himself to his revered predecessors greatly influenced Constantine's official portraiture, and contributed to the revival of certain classicizing features that had been absent from imperial portraiture for over a century.;The full breadth of Constantine's portraiture demonstrates a remarkable evolution: early coin portraits show him in the manner of the Tetrarchs with a stubble beard and blocky physique, while later portraits such as this one, made after his assumption of sole power, show a significant change. In an effort to disassociate himself from his immediate predecessors, Constantine adopted an official image that recalled the calm, youthful faces of Augustus and Trajan. This colossal portrait head once surmounted an enormous statue of the seated emperor, and displays many features characteristic of Augustan and Trajanic portraiture. Most notably, Constantine is clean-shaven and his cap of hair is thick and arranged in comma-shaped locks across his forehead (compare this with the portrait head of Augustus (07.286.115). As part of his plan to reorganize the empire, Constantine's portraiture offered a new iconography to match his new regime.;This monumental head, as in smaller portraits and coins of Constantine, presents the emperor as detached from the real world. It lacks the intimacy and individual expressiveness of earlier imperial portraits.

Kossak Gifts, 2008 (2008.30);;The author of this Kongo personification of poweramong the most impressive sculptural creations from sub-Saharan Africasought to inspire awe, to intimidate, and to evoke a power without bounds. Conceived to house specific mystical forces, Kongo power figures were the collaborative creations of sculptors and ritual specialists. This work belongs to the most ambitious class of that tradition. It is one of only twenty such figures more than a meter high identified with the preeminent force of jurisprudence, Mangaaka.;This striking sculpture is an nkisi (pl. minkisi) from the Democratic Republic of Congo. An nkisi is essentially a container of spiritual forces that are directed to investigate the underlying cause of some chronic problem. As spiritual experts, banganga are approached by clients to address any of a multitude of crises that may emerge in the community, including illness, political instability, and social strife. Minkisi are essential to the nganga's profession, creating a focal point from which to draw upon the spirit realm and its powers. Just as minkisi are directed toward specific ends, the banganga that own and control them may be specialized to address specific issues. For instance, only experienced banganga assume the responsibility of the most powerful minkisi, those concerned with political matters and the administration of justice.;After a sculptor carves the figure at the core of the nkisi, it is the responsibility of the nganga to customize it by adding symbolic materials. Consequently, each nkisi is a unique creation, and can be controlled only by the nganga that conceived of its arrangement. The nganga begins by packing various &quot;medicines&quot; into a central abdominal cavity. The diverse ingredients of the medicines may include special earths and stones, leaves and seeds, parts of animals, bird beaks and feathers, and are specifically combined to attract and direct forces to the desired goal. The figure's belly, or mooyowhich, not coincidentally, also translates as &quot;life&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;is another spiritual focal point, packed with medicines and then sealed with resin.;As the figure is used and reused, the addition of materials enhances its ability to direct forces while simultaneously augmenting its visual intricacy. As illustrated in this example, nails, bits of cloth, beads, bells, even miniature carvings have all been added to literally and figuratively load the figure with spiritual power. Many of the objects are tied to a cloth collar around the neck, a feature not commonly found on other minkisi. While prevalent teeth and wide, aggressive eyes characterize many other minkisi, this example is further distinguished by the serenity of its facial expression, a sharp contrast to the rusted nails and complex assemblage of accoutrements that ornament the body of the figure below.;The kingdom of Kongo was at the height of its power in 1482, when Portuguese sailors first visited the coast of Central Africa. Founded between 1350 and 1400, the kingdom was a model of centralized government, with a divine king and a network of advisers, provincial governors, and village chiefs who ruled as many as three million people. Portuguese navigators brought with them Catholic missionaries, who converted the kings of Kongo during the sixteenth century.

(209.6 cm);Gift of Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, 1989 (1989.407);;The Burghers of Calais, commemorating an episode during the Hundred Years' War between England and France, is probably the best and certainly the most successful of Rodin's public monuments. Rodin closely followed the account of the French chronicler Jean Froissart (1333 or 1337after 1400) stating that six of the principal citizens of Calais were ordered to come out of their besieged city with head and feet bare, ropes around their necks, and the keys of the town and the caste in their hands. They were brought before the English king Edward III (13121377), who ordered their beheading. Rodin has portrayed them at the moment of departure from their city led by Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the bearded man in the middle of the group. At his side, Jean d'Aire carres a giant-sized key. Their oversized feet are bare, many have ropes around their necks, and all are in various states of despair, expecting imminent death and unaware that their lives will ultimately be saved by the intercession of the English queen Philippa. The arrangement of the group, with its unorthodox massing and subtle internal rhythms, was not easily settled, and the completed monument, cast in bronze by the Le Blanc-Barbedienne foundry, was not unveiled in Calais until 1895. The Metropolitan Museum's bronze is a lost-wax casting made from the plaster model in the Musee Rodin in Paris.;;NOTE: Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork,Stylized"

Referencing eighteenth-century French sources, furniture in the Rococo Revival style is characterized by curved, cabriole legs, strong C- and S-curves and scrolls, and the extravagant use of carved, naturalistic ornament, particularly flowers. In keeping with the mid-nineteenth-century belief that certain styles were appropriate for specific rooms in the home, the Rococo Revival style was popular for the decoration of formal parlors, or reception rooms, and this etagere, combined with a parlor suite of seating furniture and a fine center table, would have inhabited a luxurious interior.; ;Synonymous with the colloquial term &quot;whatnot,&quot; etagere is a French word describing an arrangement of shelves, often with a mirrored back, used in nineteenth-century homes for the display of small decorative objects.

Ivory, prized throughout the ancient world, was used extensively at the time of the Assyrian Empire (ca. 883612 B.C.). The material was valued by craftsmen because it could be carved in such detail. Although modern tastes appreciate the beauty of an ivory surface, these carvings were often covered with gold foil. Many of the ivories found at Nimrud were brought as booty or tribute from the vassal states to the west of Assyria, where elephants were native and ivory carving was a long-established craft. Others were undoubtedly carved in Assyria by craftsmen brought as captives to the capital cities. Contemporary inscriptions record that Ashurnasirpal took &quot;couches of ivory overlaid with gold&quot; from a city on the western Tigris and received tribute of &quot;elephant tusks and ivory thrones overlaid with gold and silver.&quot; Thousands of ivory fragments were discovered by the British in their excavations of the ruins of Nimrud. Stripped of their gold covering by invading armies, the ivories themselves were discarded as being of little worth.;;Syrian-style ivories have been found in Syriaparticularly at the site of Arslan Tashas well as in the Assyrian palaces of northern Mesopotamia. Works in this style include both flat panels used for furniture decoration and such three-dimensional objects as circular boxes and small figures. Syrian-style ivory carving is distinguished by the stocky proportions of the figures, oval faces with small mouths and large eyes, plants with a long wavy stem, and a winged sun disc with pendant volute curls. Unlike the symmetrical compositions of Phoenician ivories, Syrian examples often depict a single figure in profile that completely fills the surface of the plaque. Nude female figures wearing elaborately curled tresses and diadems, sculpted in the round either singly or in groups, are a particularly striking theme. Syrian-style ivories were made primarily during the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.;;This ivory carving would have been one of a group of similar panels used in the back of a chair.

(297.2 cm), base: D. 34 1/8 in. (86.7 cm), W. 42 in. (106.7 cm);Fletcher Fund, 1953 (53.87a-i);;Born in America in 1904 to a Japanese father and an American mother, Isamu Noguchi spent most of his childhood in Japan (190618) before returning to the United States to continue his schooling (191824). Between 1927 and 1937, his frequent and extended travels to Europe, China, Japan, and Mexico, where he saw modern painting and sculpture being made, studied calligraphy, and painted a mural, provided him with an eclectic range of artistic experiences upon which to draw.;;Noguchi's sculptures and drawings from the mid-1940s are occupied with figurative and biomorphic imagery. Kouros illustrates the biomorphic vocabulary that Noguchi devised in order to abstract the human figure into fragmented, bonelike elements, and may be compared to the biomorphic abstractions produced by such Surrealist artists as Jean Arp, Matta, Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, and Yves Tanguy. However, Noguchi always contended that the organic quality of his work came not from Surrealist examples but from his familiarity with traditional Japanese arts and craftsbells, samurai swords, and floral arrangements.;;Although Surrealism no doubt played a part in Noguchi's use of biomorphic abstraction in the 1940s, he was already predisposed to it by an earlier and more memorable experiencethat of working with the sculptor Constantin Brancusi in Paris while traveling on a Guggenheim Fellowship. As Brancusi's part-time studio assistant for about five months in 1927, the twenty-two-year-old Noguchi learned how simple organic shapes could evoke figurative associations. He also acquired the techniques needed to carve in stone, which he first used for his own sculpture in the 1930s and which continued to dominate his aesthetic for more than fifty years. This dedication to traditional techniques and materials was in direct opposition to the more industrial welded-metal construction that was popularized in the 1940s and '50s by such sculptors as Herbert Ferber, Theodore Roszak, and David Smith.;;In all, Noguchi completed about fifteen interlocking sculptures between 1945 and 1948, including the Metropolitan Museum's famous pink marble sculpture Kouros, which is more than nine feet high. These sculptures were assembled from individual pieces of carved stone, without benefit of adhesives or pinions, by notching and slotting the pieces together. As Noguchi explained: &quot;You have to consider the weight of the material, the forces that conspire to hold up the figureengineering problems, essentially. Everything I do has an element of engineering in itparticularly since I dislike gluing parts together or taking advantage of something that is not inherent in the material ... there are no adhesives of any kindonly the stones holding themselves together.&quot;;;The fragmented figures that were created, in both drawings and sculpture, reflect Noguchi's feelings about the precarious state of the world after World War II, which he characterized as &quot;the encroaching void.&quot; Such feelings were echoed in the statements made by some of the Abstract Expressionists at the time and in the primordial and mythic imagery they chose to depict. For Noguchi, as for many Abstract Expressionists, abstraction was a way to convey the intimate relationship between contemporary man and these ancient, universal sources.;;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/na/ho_53.87a-i.htm>www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/na/ho_53.87a-i.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: modern,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: marble,ElissaSCA: kouros,ElissaSCA: abstract,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork"

This promise of salvation held great appeal to Chinese Buddhists at the end of the ninth century, for they had just been through a period a great persecution, and a cult built around the luohans as guardians gained momentum at that time.;The Museum has two statues from a group of seated luohans purportedly found in a mountain cave near Yizhou, (now known as Yixian) in Hebei Province, and dating from this unsettled period. The polychromatic glaze covering the figures has strong parallels to the well-known sancai, or three-color, tradition found in earlier Tang-dynasty funerary figures. The high quality of the designs and the use of sophisticated techniques such as reinforcing rods have long led scholars to speculate that this example, and others from the set, may have been made at one of the imperial kilns, where large firing chambers and highly skilled craftsmen were available.;The discovery of a kiln in Longquanwu at Mentougou village (a western suburb of Beijing) in 1983 and the subsequent excavation in 1985 have provided much useful information regarding the &quot;Yixian Luohans&quot; as the group is often known. In addition to a considerable quantity of sancai ware, the site also yielded three half-lifesize Buddhist sculptures: a white ceramic Buddha with a painted robe, and two bodhisattvas covered in a sancai-type glaze. Parallels to sculptures produced during the Liao dynasty suggest that the works excavated at Longquanwu date to the second half of the tenth century, while the famous Luohans were made slightly later, probably during the early years of the reign of Shengzong (9821031).;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: unitedstates,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereophotography,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: newyork,qpkarl: manhattan,qpkarl: sculpture,qpkarl: statue,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork,Stylized"

But the friendship was broken in January 1793 when Gerard denounced Gros for contemplating emigration, an accusation that could result in trial for treason. Gros probably made this sensitive and delicate portrait in Paris before Gerard departed for study in Rome in 1790; Gerard reciprocated with a handsome portrait of Gros in the wide-brimmed hat favored by revolutionaries (Musee des Augustins, Toulouse).

Gerald Cantor, 1989 (1989.407);;The Burghers of Calais, commemorating an episode during the Hundred Years' War between England and France, is probably the best and certainly the most successful of Rodin's public monuments. Rodin closely followed the account of the French chronicler Jean Froissart (1333 or 1337after 1400) stating that six of the principal citizens of Calais were ordered to come out of their besieged city with head and feet bare, ropes around their necks, and the keys of the town and the caste in their hands. They were brought before the English king Edward III (13121377), who ordered their beheading. Rodin has portrayed them at the moment of departure from their city led by Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the bearded man in the middle of the group. At his side, Jean d'Aire carres a giant-sized key.

The technical virtuosity incorporated in the draping is revealed only on close study of this example. The swags are both continuous and unbroken panels of fabric that incorporate the right fronts and backs of the gown. In her neoclassicism, Gres conformed to the antique notion of uninterrupted lengths of cloth, stitched but not cut into shape. From her earliest work, Gres introduced windows onto the body with cutouts that bared the back and midriff.

John, dressed in his &quot;rough coat of camel hair,&quot; anoints Christ with the waters of the River Jordan while an attending angel waits with Christ's robe. The mannered flow of Christ's loincloth echoes the river's swirling current, as do the circular patterns suggested by the arrangement of the figures and their gestures.

He also repainted and enlarged the cattle. When the work was exhibited in the Salon of 1852, critics bitterly attacked it, finding it tasteless and clumsy and berating the common features and countrified costumes of the three girls, the &quot;ridiculous&quot; little dog and cattle, and the painting's overall lack of unity, including traditional perspective and scale.
