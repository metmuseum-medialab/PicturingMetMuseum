SET 01,13131676454.jpg,23.2.35,Column Capital of the God Bes,Andrew Moore,"Egyptian Art at The Metropolitan - 'This large head unmistakably depicts the god known as Bes, or, more accurately, what is known as a 'Bes-image,' since Bes's appearance was sometimes adopted for other gods, and there is no name preserved on the statue. From the Kushite Period onward, images of Bes appeared on architectural support elements such as abaci, column shafts, or, rarely, large two-sided pillars. These architectural images are especially associated with mammisis, or temples celebrating the birth of a child-god; it is thought that this is related to the long association of the deity with domestic concerns and fertility. Such Bes figures are typically frontal and carved in high relief, but the depth of this figure against an abacus or shaft surface, if that is actually its origin, would have been quite unusual.  Another possibility is that the head originally belonged to a freestanding statue. A 1-meter-tall statue of Bes was found in a chapel at the Serapeum in Saqqara along with sphinxes dated to the reign of Nectanebo II. If this head comes from such a statue, the identity of the god represented by the Bes-image might not be the domestic god Bes but a number of the other gods-especially, but not exclusively, gods associated with Horus-who adopted the deity's appearance.  This head is said to have come from the site of Bubastis in the Egyptian Delta. Work at this important but much-damaged site has produced mostly hard-stone elements, but some fragments of limestone from wall decorations have also been found there. The limestone from Bubastis is visually quite similar to the stone of this head, so it could be that the statue does indeed originate there. If so, a date to the reign of Nectanebo II, who built extensively at Bubastis and whose name is attested among its limestone remains, would be a reasonable suggestion. Moreover, although there is considerable continuity in the representation of the disquieting features associated with the Bes-image in the Late Period and into the Ptolemaic Period, the carving of the god's preserved ear-which, although leonine, is greater in height than in width-is similar to that of certain images dated to the Thirtieth Dynasty.'  addl Column Capital of the God Bes Date: 332–30 B.C.

His tomb was a great shaft over sixty feet deep sunk into the desert and solid limestone bedrock in the Late Period cemetery that covers most of the area east of the Djoser complex at Saqqara. In a huge plain chamber at the bottom of the shaft, a rectangular rock core was left standing and hollowed out to house this anthropoid sarcophagus. When the tomb was excavated by the Egyptian government in 1902, the sarcophagus contained the remains of a badly decomposed gilded cedar coffin, and a mummy that wore a mask of gilded silver, gold finger and toe stalls, and numerous small amulets. Other canopic and shabti equipment accompanied the burial. The finds went to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, while this sarcophagus was purchased from the Egyptian government by the Metropolitan Museum. The sarcophagus is one of a group with plump, squarish broad faces, smooth unarticulated bodies, and slightly protruding feet that all originate in the Memphite area and date to the time around the reign of Psamtik II (ca. 595–589 B.C.); several of them may have been produced by the same workshop.

In the fresco technique, pigments mixed with water are applied directly on a fresh ( or fresco) plaster wall. As the plaster sets, a chemical reaction occurs whereby the pigment particles become locked into the wall, giving the work great durability.;The imposing figure of Saint Christopher, with wind blown garments, wades through the water carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. His identity unknown, the Christ Child asked Christopher ( meaning Christ-bearer) to help him cross the river, as he had done for others. As he grew increasingly heavy, the Christ Child revealed himself to Christopher and informed him that he was bearing the weight of the world and its creator on his shoulders. Images of Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, were often placed near the doorways of churches.

(157.5 cm);The Cesnola Collection, Purchased by subscription, 1874-76 (74.51.2453);;On the long sides: (A) procession of two chariots, two horsemen, (B) two chariots, two footmen; on the short sides: (A) mother goddesses, (B) Bes;;The Amathus sarcophagus, arguably the single most important object in the Cesnola Collection at the Metropolitan Museum, is unique among ancient Cypriot sculptures in its monumentality, its exceptionally high relief, and the preservation of its polychrome.;;The primary scenes on the long sides of the sarcophagus depict a procession of chariots escorted by attendants on horseback and followed by foot soldiers. Most likely, the figure standing under a parasol in the first chariot represents the deceased. His horses, like the others, are richly caparisoned, but the wheels of his chariot have fewer spokes. Splendidly embellished horses and chariot poles are part of a long tradition on Cyprus, although scholars have suggested that the prototypes for the chariot procession on the Amathus sarcophagus may have been Graeco-Persian reliefs.;;One of the short sides of the sarcophagus originally was decorated with four figures of the Egyptian god Bes. The cult of Bes was especially popular at Amathus, primarily because of the Phoenician presence in the city. The other short side of the sarcophagus shows four standing figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte. Nude except for their ornate necklaces, the four figures of the goddess hold their breasts in a pose that is well attested in Cypriot terracotta sculpture from the sixth century B.C. The temple of Astarte, located on the acropolis of Amathus, was one of the most important sanctuaries on Cyprus. The depictions of Bes and Astarte on this particular sarcophagus suggest the importance of procreation to the deceased.;;Most of the architectural moldings and the decorative details on the sarcophagus, such as the carved palmettes and ivy leaves that fill the four panels, are of eastern Greek origin. Other floral motifs, such as the tree of life and a frieze of lotus flowers and buds, had a long tradition in Cypriot vase painting and other arts of the Archaic and later periods. The figural panels are framed by a variety of vegetal ornaments, while the gabled lid once featured a pair of sphinxes and a palmette at each end. The thorough integration of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Cypriot stylistic elements on the Amathus sarcophagus is characteristic of Cypriot art and culture during the fifth century B.C.; ;Text from: <a href=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm>www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/04/wae/hod_74.51.2453.htm</a>  addl accession","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2007,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: relief,ElissaSCA: sarcophagus,ElissaSCA: cyprus,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork",Limestone sarcophagus: the Amathus sarcophagus, ,/visit/museum-map/galleries/greek-and-roman/174,174,Greek and Roman Art,/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=*&amp;deptids=13,Stone Sculpture,"Sculpture,Stone,Limestone,Funerary containers,Coffins,Sarcophagi",242006,74.51.2453,http://scrapi.org/object/242006,http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/242006,1722382212,https://www.flickr.com/photos/elissacorsini/1722382212/,http://c2.staticflickr.com/3/2386/1722382212_d8acba839e.jpg,http://c2.staticflickr.com/3/2386/1722382212_d8acba839e.jpg,ElissaSCA,23655879@N00,elissacorsini,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of the head as that of Marcus Agrippa appears to be confirmed by an inscribed stone base that was also discovered. ;;Agrippa was one of Augustus closest friends and supporters, who played a role in the civil wars during the 30s BC. ;;Thereafter, he acted almost as second-in-command to the emperor and as his roving ambassador, dealing with troubles in various parts of the Empire. Agrippa was rewarded with many titles and offices, including the consulship on three occasions, and in 21 BC, he married Augustus daughter Julia. Through her he was grandfather and great grandfather to the emperors Gaius (Caligula) and Nero, respectively.;;Text from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label.","ElissaSCA: metropolitanmuseum,ElissaSCA: museum,ElissaSCA: art,ElissaSCA: met,ElissaSCA: mma,ElissaSCA: manhattan,ElissaSCA: newyork,ElissaSCA: newyorkcity,ElissaSCA: ny,ElissaSCA: nyc,ElissaSCA: 2008,ElissaSCA: ancient,ElissaSCA: ancientworld,ElissaSCA: bronze,ElissaSCA: roman,ElissaSCA: sculpture,ElissaSCA: statue,ElissaSCA: head,ElissaSCA: portrait,ElissaSCA: agrippa,ElissaSCA: fujifinepixs6000fd,ElissaSCA: empire,Description,AccessionInDesc","Bronze portrait of a man, identified as M.

Gerald Cantor, 1989 (1989.407);;The Burghers of Calais, commemorating an episode during the Hundred Years' War between England and France, is probably the best and certainly the most successful of Rodin's public monuments. Rodin closely followed the account of the French chronicler Jean Froissart (1333 or 1337after 1400) stating that six of the principal citizens of Calais were ordered to come out of their besieged city with head and feet bare, ropes around their necks, and the keys of the town and the caste in their hands. They were brought before the English king Edward III (13121377), who ordered their beheading. Rodin has portrayed them at the moment of departure from their city led by Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the bearded man in the middle of the group. At his side, Jean d'Aire carres a giant-sized key. Their oversized feet are bare, many have ropes around their necks, and all are in various states of despair, expecting imminent death and unaware that their lives will ultimately be saved by the intercession of the English queen Philippa. The arrangement of the group, with its unorthodox massing and subtle internal rhythms, was not easily settled, and the completed monument, cast in bronze by the Le Blanc-Barbedienne foundry, was not unveiled in Calais until 1895.

With their himation-like draped swags, these designs are a relaxed version of the fine dense pleating that generally covers her fitted, highly structured bodices. The technical virtuosity incorporated in the draping is revealed only on close study of this example. The swags are both continuous and unbroken panels of fabric that incorporate the right fronts and backs of the gown. In her neoclassicism, Gres conformed to the antique notion of uninterrupted lengths of cloth, stitched but not cut into shape. From her earliest work, Gres introduced windows onto the body with cutouts that bared the back and midriff. The dense draping of the handkerchief-weight jersey in the gown provides carefully positioned coverage. At either side of the hips and legs, however, only a taut layer of fabric is provided for a sensuous disclosure of the body's contours.;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork",Evening dress,Madame Grès (Alix Barton),This artwork is not on display, ,Costume Institute,/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=*&amp;deptids=8, ,"Costume,Silk,Dresses,Evening dresses",80350,1994.192.12,http://scrapi.org/object/80350,http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/80350,3172698759,https://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/3172698759/,http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1012/3172698759_eed06ab552.jpg,http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1012/3172698759_eed06ab552.jpg,qpkarl,12671646@N07,,,,,,,,,,,,

An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). The figures are unusual in that the Seasons are usually portrayed as women, but here they are shown as sturdy youths. Around these five central figures are placed other Bacchic figures and cultic objects, all carved at a smaller scale. On the rounded ends of the sarcophagus are two other groups of large figures, similarly intermingled with lesser ones. On the left end, Mother Earth is portrayed reclining on the ground; she is accompanied by a satyr and a youth carrying fruit. On the right end, a bearded male figure, probably to be identified with the personification of a river-god, reclines in front of two winged youths, perhaps representing two additional Seasons. ;;<b>NOTE:</b> Look &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4577026379_ec438d4f69_o.jpg rel=nofollow>wall-eyed</a>&quot; at the top pair or &quot;<a href=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4577026407_895e8bfdd2_o.jpg rel=nofollow>cross-eyed</a>&quot; at the bottom pair to get a 3D image from the fused pictures. <a href=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5042/5284135743_b8a35ae0b1_z.jpg rel=nofollow>Another illustration</a>.;;Here's a <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/6076850770/in/photostream/>helpful tip</a> for viewing stereo pairs.;;If you'd like to browse a bit, please enjoy a somewhat <a href=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/12671646@N07/random/ rel=nofollow>random sampling</a> of my photos.  addl accession","qpkarl: 3d,qpkarl: stereo,qpkarl: stereogram,qpkarl: stereograph,qpkarl: stereography,qpkarl: canondigitalrebel,qpkarl: newyorkcity,qpkarl: metropolitanmuseum,qpkarl: artgalleryandmuseums,qpkarl: stereographic,qpkarl: stereoscope,qpkarl: stereoscopic,qpkarl: stereoscopy,qpkarl: stereophotography,Description,DescriptionInDesc,AccessionInDesc,3D,Artwork",Marble sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons, ,/visit/museum-map/galleries/greek-and-roman/162,162,Greek and Roman Art,/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=*&amp;deptids=13,Stone Sculpture,"Sculpture,Stone,Marble,Funerary containers,Coffins,Sarcophagi",254819,55.11.5,http://scrapi.org/object/254819,http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/254819,3172498384,https://www.flickr.com/photos/12671646@N07/3172498384/,http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1099/3172498384_b869f8f4c0.jpg,http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1099/3172498384_b869f8f4c0.jpg,qpkarl,12671646@N07,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work by one of his pupils most likely dates from Stoss's residence in Cracow, where he maintained a thriving workshop for nearly twenty years before returning to Nuremberg in 1496. The composition was adapted from an engraving by Martin Schongauer of the Baptism of Christ. It probably once included the figures of God the Father and the dove of the Holy Spirit shown blessing the event in accordance with scripture: &quot;He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him; and a voice from heaven was heard saying, 'This is my Son, my Beloved, on whom my favor rests'&quot; (Matthew 3:1617). John, dressed in his &quot;rough coat of camel hair,&quot; anoints Christ with the waters of the River Jordan while an attending angel waits with Christ's robe. The mannered flow of Christ's loincloth echoes the river's swirling current, as do the circular patterns suggested by the arrangement of the figures and their gestures. Originally, this work would have been part of an altarpiece; it is perhaps from a lateral wing composed of a much larger ensemble of scenes.

(194.9 x 261 cm);;Credit Line;Gift of Harry Payne Bingham, 1940;;Accession Number;40.175;;This painting, which initiated a series of pictures devoted to the lives of women, shows Courbet's three sisters out for a walk in the Communal, a small valley near his native village of Ornans. Painted during the winter of 185152, &quot;Young Ladies of the Village&quot; was preceded by several studies including an oil sketch (Leeds City Art Gallery) in which Courbet established the leading features of the Metropolitan's picture. In this, the final work, he gave the figures a more prominent role and altered the landscape, omitting the two large trees that in the study are silhouetted against the sky. He also repainted and enlarged the cattle. When the work was exhibited in the Salon of 1852, critics bitterly attacked it, finding it tasteless and clumsy and berating the common features and countrified costumes of the three girls, the &quot;ridiculous&quot; little dog and cattle, and the painting's overall lack of unity, including traditional perspective and scale. Ironically, the very effects that Courbet worked hardest to achieve were the ones that proved most troublesome.","Maulleigh: young,Maulleigh: women,Maulleigh: from,Maulleigh: village,Maulleigh: gustave,Maulleigh: courbet,Maulleigh: metropolitanmuseum,Maulleigh: metropolitan,Maulleigh: museum,Maulleigh: art,Maulleigh: met,Description,AccessionInDesc,2D,Artwork",Young Ladies of the Village,Gustave Courbet,/visit/museum-map/galleries/european-paintings/812,812,European Paintings,/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=*&amp;deptids=11,Paintings,"Paintings,Canvas,Oil paint",438820,40.175,http://scrapi.org/object/438820,http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/438820,3169111084,https://www.flickr.com/photos/maulleigh/3169111084/,http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1170/3169111084_87f07b15b0.jpg,http://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1170/3169111084_87f07b15b0.jpg,Maulleigh,17884832@N00,maulleigh,,,,,,,,,,,
