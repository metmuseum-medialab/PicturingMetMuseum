      "_content": "[This photograph was Identify the Painter(26)]\n\nAlexandre Franҫois Desportes\nFrench, Champigneul 1661-1743 Paris\n\nDetail from  <b><i> Still Life with Silver </i></b>\nOil on canvas\nSigned (lower right): Desportes\nTrained as a painter of animals and favored by both Louis XIV (1638-1715) and Louis XV (1710-1774), Desportes achieved fame not only for his hunting scenes but also for his opulent still lifes.  This picture, possibly painted in the late 1720s, belongs to a type showing  a buffet laden with an array of objects in silver, porcelain, and semi-precious  stone as well as fruit—such as might have been displayed for a banquet.  The objects are likely to record actual pieces owned by the patron: the dragon-handled tureen and vermeil salvers are in the Régence style (ca. 1715-23).\nThe corners of the picture were cut, probably so that the canvas could be set into wood paneling; the current corners are modern.\nPurchase, Mary Wetmore Shively Bequest, in memory of her husband, Henry L. Shively, M.D., 1964\n64.315\n\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n.\n.\n<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=6946981668&amp;bg=white&amp;size=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">View On White</a>"
