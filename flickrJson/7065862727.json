After seven years of study in London, Earl became an itinerant artist in Connecticut and Vermont; he devised a manner of painting that betrayed his knowledge of fashionable English portraiture while appealing to his clientsâ€™ restrained tastes and pious values.  A key example is this complex group portrait of Chloe Burrall Smith (1757-1810) and her five children, a grand and stylish work executed in Bennington, Vermont, in a simple technique and vivid palette of greens and reds.\nGift of Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, 1964 \n64.309.1\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=7065862727&amp;bg=white&amp;size=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">View On White</a>\n.\n"
