Breton wrote in his autobiography that one evening in the fields near his native village of Courrières in northern France he had come across this twilight scene of peasants pulling up “thistles and weeds…their faces haloed by the pink transparency of their violet hoods, as if to venerate a fecundating star.”  It had presented itself to him as a “finished picture,” completed even as far as “the breadth of the lines, intensity of the effect, character, richness and simplicity.”\nBequest of Collis P. Huntington, 1900\n25.110.66\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n"
