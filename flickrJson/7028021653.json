American, 1884-1958\nDetail from: <b><i> Mr. and Mrs. Chester Dale Dine Out </i></b>  1924\nOil on canvas \nPène du Bois’s  portrayals of New York’s high society between the wars frequently record the telling body language of his protagonists.  This commissioned work depicts Chester Dale ( a wealthy investment banker and prominent art collector) and his first wife, Maud ( a painter and writer),  seated stiffly in the fashionable Hotel Brevoort.  In the early 1920s, their collection featured American art ( including twentiy-five paintings by Pène du Bois).  Subsequent acquisitions, however, focused almost exclusively on French painting, from the late eighteenth to the twentieth century.  Several important paintings including Salvador Dalí’s 1954 <i>Crucifixion</i>, were given to the Metropolitan Museum; the majority of the Chester Dale Collection is now at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\nGift of Chester Dale, 1963\n63.138.1\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=7028021653&amp;bg=white&amp;size=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">View On White</a>"
