      "_content": "Thomas Eakins  \n(1844-1916)\n\n<b><i> The Champion Single Sculls (Max Schmitt in a Single Scull)</i></b>\n1871\nOil on canvas\nReturning to Philadelphia from Europe in 1870, Eakins began a series of representations of the sport of sculling, a subject with which he is uniquely identified.  This,  the first major work in the series, probably commemorates the victory of  Max Schmitt (1843-1900), an attorney and skilled amateur rower, in an important race held on the Schuylkill River in October 1870.  Also an avid rower, Eakins depicted himself pulling oars of a scull in the middle distance.  Eakins constructed the painting according to the academic principles espoused by his primary Parisian teacher, Jean-Léon Gérôme.\n\nPurchase, The Alfred N. Punnett Endowment Fund and George D. Pratt Gift, 1934\n34.92\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n"
