      "_content": "audience hall in the palace of Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 B.C.)\n&quot;Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made [the palace] fittingly imposing&quot; (from the Standard Inscription of Ashurnasirpal II).\n\nYou have to look at the Lamassu from the front, isolate the surroundings and forget the carvings of the Lamassu. Only observe the outside form of it.\nYes my curious reader, it is the religion of Nimrod, represented by Lamassus, Obelisks.\nThe Vatican has an obelisk right in front of it.\nWashington DC has a huge obelisk, Buenos Aires also.\nThe Eiffel Tower is an obelisk.\nThe three horned crown of the Lamassu represents, aHXur, Anu, and Enlil\nThe Pope has written in his Mitre, Vicarius Filii Dei (Vicar of the Son of God)\nThe ancient babylonian priests are everywhere, and some of them keep carrying the same triple hat, a mitre, such as the Pope.\nAsshur, the assyrian god is alive and well..., in the Vatican.\nFrom Assyria and Babylon to the Vatican, not much has really changed.\nPhallus everywhere.\n\nThe Assyrians called the Lamassu, Ninip, the horned “god of forces”.\nThe god which the Antichrist honours, is “the god of forces” the protector of fortresses.\n\nDaniel 11\n36And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.\n 37Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.\n 38But in his estate shall he honour the GOD OF FORCES: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.\n 39Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.\n\nRev. 9\n 7And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.\n 8And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.\n 9And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.\n 10And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.\n 11And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.\n\n\n_______________\n(Source Metropolitan Museum of Art)\nStandard Inscription\nAn inscription was carved across the surface of each of the large stone relief panels that lined the walls of the Northwest Palace. This text is now called the Standard Inscription because it is repeated with only minor variations on each slab.\n[Location] The palace of Ashurnasirpal,\n[Lineage of the King] chief priest of Ashur, the chosen one of Enlil and Ninurta, the favorite of Anu and Dagan, the divine weapon of the Great Gods, the potent king, the king of the world, the king of Assyria; the son of Tukulti-Ninurta, the great king, the potent king, the king of the world, the king of Assyria; the son of Adad-nirari, the king of the world, the king of Assyria; \n[The Heroic Warrior] the powerful warrior who always lived by [his trust] in Ashur, his lord; who has no rival among the princes of the four quarters of the earth; [who is] the shepherd of his people, fearless in battle, the overpowering tidewater who has no opponent; [who is] the king, subjugator of the unsubmissive, who rules the total sum of all humanity; [who is] the potent warrior, who tramples his enemies, who crushes all the adversaries; [who is] the disperser of the host of the haughty; [who is] the king who always lived by [his] trust in the Great Gods, his lords; and captured all the lands himself, ruled all their mountainous districts, [and] received their tribute; who takes hostages, who establishes victory over all their lands. \n[Summary of the Campaign] When Ashur, who selected me, who made my kingship great, entrusted his merciless weapon into my lordly arms, I verily struck down the widespread troops of Lullumu with weapons, during the battle encounter. As for the troops of the lands of Nairi, Habhu, Shubaru, and Nirbu, I roared over them like Adad the destroyer, with the aid of Shamash and Adad, my helper gods. [I am] the king who caused [the lands] from the other bank of the Tigris to the Lebanon and the Great Sea, the whole of Laqu, and Suhu as far as Rapiqu, to submit; [who] himself conquered [the territory] from the source of the Subnat River to Urartu; [who] annexed as my own territory [the area] from the pass of Kirruru to Gilzanu, from the other bank of the Lower Zab to Til Bari which is upstream from Zaban, from Til sha Abtani to Til sha Zabdani. I counted as my own people [those who occupy the territory] from the pass of Babite to Hashmar. I set my resident [official]s in the lands over which I ruled [and imposed upon them] obeisance and [forced labor]. \n[The King as Warrior and Protector of His People] [I am] Ashurnasirpal, the obedient prince, the worshiper of the Great Gods, the fierce dragon, the conqueror of all cities and mountains to their full extent, the king of rulers, who tames the dangerous enemies, the [one] crowned with glory, the [one] unafraid of battle, the relentless lion, who shakes resistance, the king [deserving] of praise, the shepherd, protection of the world, the king whose command blots out mountains and seas, who forced into compliance the relentless, fierce kings from the east to the west at his very approach. \n[The City] The former Kalhu, which Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, the lord my predecessor, built—that city was dilapidated and deserted. I built that city anew. As for my own captives from the lands over which I ruled—those from Suhu, the whole of Laqu, Sirqu which is on the opposite bank of the Euphrates-crossing, all Zamua, Bit Adini, and Hattu, and that of Lubarna of Hattina—I took and settled them therein. I removed the ancient tell. I went down as far as the headwaters. I laid in 120 brick courses into the depths. (From [the level of] the headwaters, I made a fill of 120 brick courses up to the top.) \n[The Palace] I built thereon [a palace with] halls of cedar, cypress, juniper, boxwood, teak, terebinth, and tamarisk [?] as my royal dwelling and for the enduring leisure life of my lordship. Beasts of the mountains and the seas, which I had fashioned out of white limestone and alabaster, I had set up in its gates. I made [the palace] fittingly imposing. I bordered them all around with bronze studs. I mounted doors of cedar, cypress, juniper, and terebinth in its gates. Silver, gold, tin, bronze, iron, my own booty from the lands over which I ruled, as much as possible, I brought [to the palace]; I placed it all therein. "
