      "_content": "Mary Cassatt (1844-1926)\nDetail from: <b><i> The Cup of Tea </i></b>\nCa. 1880--81\nOil on canvas\n\nTaking afternoon tea was a social ritual for many upper-middle-class women.  Committed to portraying the ordinary events of everyday life, the artist made that ritual the subject of a series of works painted around 1880, when she had been living abroad for the better part of a decade.  Her model  for this canvas was her sister, Lydia, who had moved to Paris, along with their parents, in 1877 and often posed for her.  Cassattâ€™s embrace of French Impressionism is signaled by her scintillating brushwork, high-keyed palette, and emphasis on contrasting complimentary colors.  Cassatt showed the painting to critical acclaim in the 1881 Impressionist exhibition.\nFrom the Collection of James Stillman,\nGift of Dr. Ernest G. Stillman, 1922\n22.16.17\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=6843569314&amp;bg=white&amp;size=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">View On White</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/20010734#fullscreen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metropolitan Museum Linkl<a></a></a></b>\n.\n.\n"
