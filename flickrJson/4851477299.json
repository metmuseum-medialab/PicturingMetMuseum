      "_content": "<b><i>The Death of Socrates</i> by Jacques-Louis David</b>\n\n(51 x 77 1/4 in.)\n\nAccused by the Athenian government of denying the gods and corrupting the young through his teachings, Socrates (469–399 B.C.) was offered the choice of renouncing his beliefs or being sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. David shows him calmly discoursing on the immortality of the soul with his grief-stricken disciples. Painted in 1787, the picture, with its stoic theme, is perhaps David's most perfect Neoclassical statement. The printmaker and publisher John Boydell wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds that it was &quot;the greatest effort of art since the Sistine Chapel and the stanze of Raphael. . . . This work would have done honour to Athens at the time of Pericles.&quot; The subject is loosely based on Plato's Phaedo, but in painting it David consulted a variety of sources, including Diderot's treatise on dramatic poetry of 1758 and works by the poet André Chenier. The pose of the figure at the foot of the bed was reportedly inspired by a passage in a novel by the English writer Richardson.\n\nSource: Jacques-Louis David: The Death of Socrates (31.45) | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\n<a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/31.45\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/31.45</a>\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Death of Socrates is a 1787 painting by the French painter Jacques-Louis David.\n\nIt represents the scene of the death of Greek philosopher Socrates, condemned to die by drinking hemlock, for the expression of his ideas against those of Athens' and corrupting the minds of the youth. The painting also depicts both Plato and Crito, with the former sitting ruefully at the edge of the bed and the latter clutching the knee of Socrates. Socrates had the choice to go into exile (and hence give up his philosophic vocation) or be sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. Socrates chose death. In this painting, a red-robed disciple hands a confident Socrates the goblet of hemlock. Socrates' hand pointing to the heavens indicating his defiance of the gods and fearless attitude to his death.\n\nThis painting is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as one of Jacques-Louis David's greatest pieces of art.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Socrates\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Socrates</a>"
