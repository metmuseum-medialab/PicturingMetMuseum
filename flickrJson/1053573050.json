      "_content": "In a time when emperors were hard-pressed to maintain their position of power, some ruled for as little as a few months and in many ways were wholly dependent on the fickle attitudes of their armies. Trebonianus Gallus became emperor after the assassination of his predecessor, Decius, and with the support of his army. In his portraiture, most notably on coins and a few sculptures, Gallus continued the iconographic tradition that was intended to present the emperor as a powerful general who could lead the armies and keep order in the empire. This iconography is characterized by a military &quot;buzz-cut&quot; hairstyle, a short, stubble beard, and a stern, even menacing expression—all of which owe their origins to the mature portrait types of Caracalla (r. 211–17 A.D.) (40.11.1a).\n\nReconstructed from several fragments, this statue is remarkable because it is the only large-scale bronze to survive from the third century A.D., as well as the fact that it is one of the relatively few lifesize imperial bronzes to come down from antiquity. Although its identification as Trebonianus is not absolute, the features bear a strong resemblance to the portraits minted on some of his official coins. \n\nThe overall intent of this oversized bronze statue seems to have been to intimidate by virtue of its sheer physical presence, and clearly reflects the immense stylistic evolution in Roman portraiture since the time of Augustus. The portrait head shows an incredible emotional intensity that contrasts sharply with the disproportionately large and muscular body. The massive nude body itself resembles that of an athlete or gladiator, such as those in the mosaic pavements of the Baths of Caracalla, rather than what was typical for a representation of an emperor. In fact, the boots Gallus wears are of a type often shown in representations of boxers, and would have been more appropriate for the palaestra, or exercise yard, than the imperial court.\n\nAlthough his pose is one routinely adopted by Roman emperors—recalling Greek heroic and athletic nude statues—the disproportion, wrestling gear, brutish crew cut, and stubble beard no longer evoke the ideals of classical Greece as in the days of Augustus. The technique of negative carving, which had been designed in the early third century for stone portraits of Caracalla, is here successfully used in the decoration of metal. This abbreviated style befits Gallus, an emperor who both achieved and lost the throne at the hands of the soldiers he led.\n \nText (slightly abridged) from: <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropo/hod_05.30_05.47.htm</a>\n\nFor an article on the conservation of this work: <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_2003/roman.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/fall_...</a>\n\nand\n\nBronze statue of the emperor Trebonianus Gallus\nRoman, 251-253 AD\nSaid to have been found near the church of Saint John the Lateran in Rome\n\nAccession # 05.30\n\nThis monumental bronze statue is one of the very few nearly complete Roman bronze statues of the third century preserved today.  It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different.  Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived.  Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos.  In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism.  Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or a short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand.  \n\nThe statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth century and was examined in great detail as part of the conservation treatment in preparation for its display here.  Visual examination inside and out, combined with x-radiography, made possible the clear identification of ancient and restored areas, which are indicated in the accompanying illustration.  At least three-quarters of the statue is ancient.  Despite the discrepancy in scale, the head belongs to the body.  Although the mantle draped over his right shoulder is a modern restoration, cast edges beneath it confirm that the statue had a similar embellishment in antiquity.  The left foot with its elaborately decorated open-fronted boot appears to be ancient but may not belong.\n\nText from the Metropolitan Museum of Art label. \n"
