Gerome\nAlthough  Gérôme’s fame rests on his Orientalist imagery, he was also a prolific animalier.  Late in life, he recalled that as a young artist he made daily visits to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris during the summer months and produced studies inspired by these visits.  In the 1880s, Gérôme persisted in painting tigers in imaginary landscapes.  The tiger is not indigenous to North Africa, but the rocky terrain of “Tiger and Cubs” is evocative of Egypt, where Gérôme first traveled in 1856.  The picture was probably painted about 1884, along with a nocturnal desert scene with a tiger that exhibited at that year’s Salon (“La Nuit au desert”; now lost).\n\nBequest of Susan P. Colgate, in memory of her husband, Romulus R. Colgate, 1936\n36.162.4\n\n\n\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</i></b>"
