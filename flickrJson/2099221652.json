    },
    "description": {
      "_content": "<i>Wall painting from a cubiculum nocturnum (bedroom)</i>\n last decade of the 1st century B.C.; Early Imperial, Augustan; Third Style\nRoman\nFresco; H. 73 3/4 in. (187.33 cm.) width 47 in. (119.38 cm.)\n\nThis fresco once decorated the west wall of bedroom 19, the Mythological Room, in the Imperial Villa at Boscotrecase. Third-Style Roman bedrooms were often adorned with mythological scenes that apparently imitated the framed paintings that hung in Roman houses. This example shows the Cyclops Polyphemus as the unsuccessful suitor of the lovely sea nymph Galatea, who rides a dolphin at the lower left. Polyphemus is seated in the center of a rocky outcrop, professing his desire for Galatea with a melody on his panpipe, but to no avail. As told by Ovid, Galatea hid with her lover Acis, the son of Pan, while she listened to the Cyclop's song, but he discovered them and rose in rage, crushing Acis under a boulder as he tried to escape. This wall painting comes from a bedroom in the imperial villa uncovered between 1902 and 1905 near the modern town of Boscotrecase, not far from Pompeii. The walls were predominately red and a large mythological painting filled the center on each side of the room. The painting seen here combines two separate incidents in the life of the monstrous, one-eyed giant, Polyphemus. In the foreground he sits on a rocky projection guarding his goats and gazing at Galatea, the beautiful sea-nymph with whom he is hopelessly in love. Behind and above to the right, he is seen again, hurling a boulder at the departing ship of Odysseus, who has escaped with his men from the giant's cave after blinding him. The landscape painting in the same room includes two consecutive incidents in the story of Perseus and Andromeda. At the front Perseus flies in to rescue the princess who is chained to a rock at the mercy of a seamonster; above to the right the happy couple are welcomed by her grateful parents. The fortunes of love and the ever-present sea are the themes linking these two works. The combination of disparate episodes in one panel was a bold innovation when these were painted. The translucent blue-green background tone unifies these magical landscapes and must have brought a sense of coolness to the room. \n\nRogers Fund, 1920 (20.192.17)\n\n**\nThe April 20, 2007 unveiling of the 30,000 square foot Greek and Roman Galleries concluded a 15-year project and returned thousands of works from the Museums permanent collection to public view. Over 5,300 objects, created between about 900 B.C. and the early fourth century A.D., are displayed, tracing the parallel stories of the evolution of Greek art in the Hellenistic period and the arts of southern Italy and Etruria and culminating in the rich and varied world of the Roman Empire from from the Late Republican period and the Golden Age of Augustuss Principate to the conversion of Constantine the Great in A.D. 312.  The centerpiece of the new installation is the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/522663013/\">Leon Levy and Shelby White Court</a>, a monumental, peristyle cour court with a soaring two-story atrium that links the various galleries and themes. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/246896968/\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s permanent collection contains more than two million works of art from around the world.  It opened its doors on February 20, 1872, housed in a building located at 681 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Under their guidance of John Taylor Johnston and George Palmer Putnam, the Met's holdings, initially consisting of a Roman stone sarcophagus and 174 mostly European paintings, quickly outgrew the available space. In 1873, occasioned by the Met's purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot antiquities, the museum decamped from Fifth Avenue and took up residence at the Douglas Mansion on West 14th Street. However, these new accommodations were temporary; after negotiations with the city of New York, the Met acquired land on the east side of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594192309086/\">Central Park</a>, where it built its permanent home, a red-brick Gothic Revival stone &quot;mausoleum&quot; designed by American architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mold.  As of 2006, the Met measures almost a quarter mile long and occupies more than two million square feet, more than 20 times the size of the original 1880 building.\n\nIn 2007, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was ranked #17 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967.  The interior was designated in 1977. \n\nNational Historic  Register #86003556"
