His portraits and history pictures remained superficially faithful to Rembrandt’s manner until the 1650s, when he, like Van der Helst and Bol, turned to a lighter, looser style based on Flemish models.\n\nBequest of Collis P. Huntington, 1900\n25.110.27\n\nFrom the placard:  Metropolitan Museum of Art\n"
